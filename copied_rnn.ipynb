I think not on my father;\\r\\nAnd these great tears grace his remembrance more\\r\\nThan those I shed for him. What was he like?\\r\\nI have forgot him: my imagination\\r\\nCarries no favour in't but Bertram's.\\r\\nI am undone: there is no living, none,\\r\\nIf Bertram be away. 'Twere all one\\r\\nThat I should love a bright particular star\\r\\nAnd think to wed it, he is so above me:\\r\\nIn his bright radiance and collateral light\\r\\nMust I be comforted, not in his sphere.\\r\\nThe ambition in my love thus plagues itself:\\r\\nThe hind that would be mated by the lion\\r\\nMust die for love. 'Twas pretty, though plague,\\r\\nTo see him every hour; to sit and draw\\r\\nHis arched brows, his hawking eye, his curls,\\r\\nIn our heart's table; heart too capable\\r\\nOf every line and trick of his sweet favour:\\r\\nBut now he's gone, and my idolatrous fancy\\r\\nMust sanctify his reliques. Who comes here?\\r\\nEnter PAROLLES\\r\\n\\r\\nAside\\r\\n\\r\\nOne that goes with him: I love him for his sake;\\r\\nAnd yet I know him a notorious liar,\\r\\nThink him a great way fool, solely a coward;\\r\\nYet these fixed evils sit so fit in him,\\r\\nThat they take place, when virtue's steely bones\\r\\nLook bleak i' the cold wind: withal, full oft we see\\r\\nCold wisdom waiting on superfluous folly.\\r\\nPAROLLES\\r\\nSave you, fair queen!\\r\\nHELENA\\r\\nAnd you, monarch!\\r\\nPAROLLES\\r\\nNo.\\r\\nHELENA\\r\\nAnd no.\\r\\nPAROLLES\\r\\nAre you meditating on virginity?\\r\\nHELENA\\r\\nAy. You have some stain of soldier in you: let me\\r\\nask you a question. Man is enemy to virginity; how\\r\\nmay we barricado it against him?\\r\\nPAROLLES\\r\\nKeep him out.\\r\\nHELENA\\r\\nBut he assails; and our virginity, though valiant,\\r\\nin the defence yet is weak: unfold to us some\\r\\nwarlike resistance.\\r\\nPAROLLES\\r\\nThere is none: man, sitting down before you, will\\r\\nundermine you and blow you up.\\r\\nHELENA\\r\\nBless our poor virginity from underminers and\\r\\nblowers up! Is there no military policy, how\\r\\nvirgins might blow up men?\\r\\nPAROLLES\\r\\nVirginity being blown down, man will quicklier be\\r\\nblown up: marry, in blowing him down again, with\\r\\nthe breach yourselves made, you lose your city. It\\r\\nis not politic in the commonwealth of nature to\\r\\npreserve virginity. Loss of virginity is rational\\r\\nincrease and there was never virgin got till\\r\\nvirginity was first lost. That you were made of is\\r\\nmetal to make virgins. Virginity by being once lost\\r\\nmay be ten times found; by being ever kept, it is\\r\\never lost: 'tis too cold a companion; away with 't!\\r\\nHELENA\\r\\nI will stand for 't a little, though therefore I die a virgin.\\r\\nPAROLLES\\r\\nThere's little can be said in 't; 'tis against the\\r\\nrule of nature. To speak on the part of virginity,\\r\\nis to accuse your mothers; which is most infallible\\r\\ndisobedience. He that hangs himself is a virgin:\\r\\nvirginity murders itself and should be buried in\\r\\nhighways out of all sanctified limit, as a desperate\\r\\noffendress against nature. Virginity breeds mites,\\r\\nmuch like a cheese; consumes itself to the very\\r\\nparing, and so dies with feeding his own stomach.\\r\\nBesides, virginity is peevish, proud, idle, made of\\r\\nself-love, which is the most inhibited sin in the\\r\\ncanon. Keep it not; you cannot choose but loose\\r\\nby't: out with 't! within ten year it will make\\r\\nitself ten, which is a goodly increase; and the\\r\\nprincipal itself not much the worse: away with 't!\\r\\nHELENA\\r\\nHow might one do, sir, to lose it to her own liking?\\r\\nPAROLLES\\r\\nLet me see: marry, ill, to like him that ne'er it\\r\\nlikes. 'Tis a commodity will lose the gloss with\\r\\nlying; the longer kept, the less worth: off with 't\\r\\nwhile 'tis vendible; answer the time of request.\\r\\nVirginity, like an old courtier, wears her cap out\\r\\nof fashion: richly suited, but unsuitable: just\\r\\nlike the brooch and the tooth-pick, which wear not\\r\\nnow. Your date is better in your pie and your\\r\\nporridge than in your cheek; and your virginity,\\r\\nyour old virginity, is like one of our French\\r\\nwithered pears, it looks ill, it eats drily; marry,\\r\\n'tis a withered pear; it was formerly better;\\r\\nmarry, yet 'tis a withered pear: will you anything with it?\\r\\nHELENA\\r\\nNot my virginity yet [ ]\\r\\nThere shall your master have a thousand loves,\\r\\nA mother and a mistress and a friend,\\r\\nA phoenix, captain and an enemy,\\r\\nA guide, a goddess, and a sovereign,\\r\\nA counsellor, a traitress, and a dear;\\r\\nHis humble ambition, proud humility,\\r\\nHis jarring concord, and his discord dulcet,\\r\\nHis faith, his sweet disaster; with a world\\r\\nOf pretty, fond, adoptious christendoms,\\r\\nThat blinking Cupid gossips.

Enter the KING of France, with letters, and divers Attendants\\r\\nKING\\r\\nThe Florentines and Senoys are by the ears;\\r\\nHave fought with equal fortune and continue\\r\\nA braving war.\\r\\nFirst Lord\\r\\nSo 'tis reported, sir.\\r\\nKING\\r\\nNay, 'tis most credible; we here received it\\r\\nA certainty, vouch'd from our cousin Austria,\\r\\nWith caution that the Florentine will move us\\r\\nFor speedy aid; wherein our dearest friend\\r\\nPrejudicates the business and would seem\\r\\nTo have us make denial.\\r\\nFirst Lord\\r\\nHis love and wisdom,\\r\\nApproved so to your majesty, may plead\\r\\nFor amplest credence.\\r\\nKING\\r\\nHe hath arm'd our answer,\\r\\nAnd Florence is denied before he comes:\\r\\nYet, for our gentlemen that mean to see\\r\\nThe Tuscan service, freely have they leave\\r\\nTo stand on either part.\\r\\nSecond Lord\\r\\nIt well may serve\\r\\nA nursery to our gentry, who are sick\\r\\nFor breathing and exploit.\\r\\nKING\\r\\nWhat's he comes here?\\r\\nEnter BERTRAM, LAFEU, and PAROLLES\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst Lord\\r\\nIt is the Count Rousillon, my good lord,\\r\\nYoung Bertram.\\r\\nKING\\r\\nYouth, thou bear'st thy father's face;\\r\\nFrank nature, rather curious than in haste,\\r\\nHath well composed thee. Thy father's moral parts\\r\\nMayst thou inherit too! Welcome to Paris.\\r\\nBERTRAM\\r\\nMy thanks and duty are your majesty's.\\r\\nKING\\r\\nI would I had that corporal soundness now,\\r\\nAs when thy father and myself in friendship\\r\\nFirst tried our soldiership! He did look far\\r\\nInto the service of the time and was\\r\\nDiscipled of the bravest: he lasted long;\\r\\nBut on us both did haggish age steal on\\r\\nAnd wore us out of act. It much repairs me\\r\\nTo talk of your good father. In his youth\\r\\nHe had the wit which I can well observe\\r\\nTo-day in our young lords; but they may jest\\r\\nTill their own scorn return to them unnoted\\r\\nEre they can hide their levity in honour;\\r\\nSo like a courtier, contempt nor bitterness\\r\\nWere in his pride or sharpness; if they were,\\r\\nHis equal had awaked them, and his honour,\\r\\nClock to itself, knew the true minute when\\r\\nException bid him speak, and at this time\\r\\nHis tongue obey'd his hand: who were below him\\r\\nHe used as creatures of another place\\r\\nAnd bow'd his eminent top to their low ranks,\\r\\nMaking them proud of his humility,\\r\\nIn their poor praise he humbled. Such a man\\r\\nMight be a copy to these younger times;\\r\\nWhich, follow'd well, would demonstrate them now\\r\\nBut goers backward.\\r\\nBERTRAM\\r\\nHis good remembrance, sir,\\r\\nLies richer in your thoughts than on his tomb;\\r\\nSo in approof lives not his epitaph\\r\\nAs in your royal speech.\\r\\nKING\\r\\nWould I were with him! He would always say--\\r\\nMethinks I hear him now; his plausive words\\r\\nHe scatter'd not in ears, but grafted them,\\r\\nTo grow there and to bear,--'Let me not live,'--\\r\\nThis his good melancholy oft began,\\r\\nOn the catastrophe and heel of pastime,\\r\\nWhen it was out,--'Let me not live,' quoth he,\\r\\n'After my flame lacks oil, to be the snuff\\r\\nOf younger spirits, whose apprehensive senses\\r\\nAll but new things disdain; whose judgments are\\r\\nMere fathers of their garments; whose constancies\\r\\nExpire before their fashions.' This he wish'd;\\r\\nI after him do after him wish too,\\r\\nSince I nor wax nor honey can bring home,\\r\\nI quickly were dissolved from my hive,\\r\\nTo give some labourers room.\\r\\nSecond Lord\\r\\nYou are loved, sir:\\r\\nThey that least lend it you shall lack you first.\\r\\nKING\\r\\nI fill a place, I know't. How long is't, count,\\r\\nSince the physician at your father's died?\\r\\nHe was much famed.\\r\\nBERTRAM\\r\\nSome six months since, my lord.\\r\\nKING\\r\\nIf he were living, I would try him yet.\\r\\nLend me an arm; the rest have worn me out\\r\\nWith several applications; nature and sickness\\r\\nDebate it at their leisure. Welcome, count;\\r\\nMy son's no dearer.\\r\\nBERTRAM\\r\\nThank your majesty.\\r\\nExeunt. Flourish\\r\\n\\r\\nSCENE III. Rousillon.

Get you gone, sirrah:\\r\\nthe complaints I have heard of you I do not all\\r\\nbelieve: 'tis my slowness that I do not; for I know\\r\\nyou lack not folly to commit them, and have ability\\r\\nenough to make such knaveries yours.\\r\\nClown\\r\\n'Tis not unknown to you, madam, I am a poor fellow.\\r\\nCOUNTESS\\r\\nWell, sir.\\r\\nClown\\r\\nNo, madam, 'tis not so well that I am poor, though\\r\\nmany of the rich are damned: but, if I may have\\r\\nyour ladyship's good will to go to the world, Isbel\\r\\nthe woman and I will do as we may.\\r\\nCOUNTESS\\r\\nWilt thou needs be a beggar?\\r\\nClown\\r\\nI do beg your good will in this case.\\r\\nCOUNTESS\\r\\nIn what case?\\r\\nClown\\r\\nIn Isbel's case and mine own. Service is no\\r\\nheritage: and I think I shall never have the\\r\\nblessing of God till I have issue o' my body; for\\r\\nthey say barnes are blessings.\\r\\nCOUNTESS\\r\\nTell me thy reason why thou wilt marry.\\r\\nClown\\r\\nMy poor body, madam, requires it: I am driven on\\r\\nby the flesh; and he must needs go that the devil drives.\\r\\nCOUNTESS\\r\\nIs this all your worship's reason?\\r\\nClown\\r\\nFaith, madam, I have other holy reasons such as they\\r\\nare.\\r\\nCOUNTESS\\r\\nMay the world know them?\\r\\nClown\\r\\nI have been, madam, a wicked creature, as you and\\r\\nall flesh and blood are; and, indeed, I do marry\\r\\nthat I may repent.\\r\\nCOUNTESS\\r\\nThy marriage, sooner than thy wickedness.\\r\\nClown\\r\\nI am out o' friends, madam; and I hope to have\\r\\nfriends for my wife's sake.\\r\\nCOUNTESS\\r\\nSuch friends are thine enemies, knave.\\r\\nClown\\r\\nYou're shallow, madam, in great friends; for the\\r\\nknaves come to do that for me which I am aweary of.\\r\\nHe that ears my land spares my team and gives me\\r\\nleave to in the crop; if I be his cuckold, he's my\\r\\ndrudge: he that comforts my wife is the cherisher\\r\\nof my flesh and blood; he that cherishes my flesh\\r\\nand blood loves my flesh and blood; he that loves my\\r\\nflesh and blood is my friend: ergo, he that kisses\\r\\nmy wife is my friend. If men could be contented to\\r\\nbe what they are, there were no fear in marriage;\\r\\nfor young Charbon the Puritan and old Poysam the\\r\\nPapist, howsome'er their hearts are severed in\\r\\nreligion, their heads are both one; they may jowl\\r\\nhorns together, like any deer i' the herd.\\r\\nCOUNTESS\\r\\nWilt thou ever be a foul-mouthed and calumnious knave?\\r\\nClown\\r\\nA prophet I, madam; and I speak the truth the next\\r\\nway:\\r\\nFor I the ballad will repeat,\\r\\nWhich men full true shall find;\\r\\nYour marriage comes by destiny,\\r\\nYour cuckoo sings by kind.\\r\\nCOUNTESS\\r\\nGet you gone, sir; I'll talk with you more anon.\\r\\nSteward\\r\\nMay it please you, madam, that he bid Helen come to\\r\\nyou: of her I am to speak.\\r\\nCOUNTESS\\r\\nSirrah, tell my gentlewoman I would speak with her;\\r\\nHelen, I mean.\\r\\nClown\\r\\nWas this fair face the cause, quoth she,\\r\\nWhy the Grecians sacked Troy?\\r\\nFond done, done fond,\\r\\nWas this King Priam's joy?\\r\\nWith that she sighed as she stood,\\r\\nWith that she sighed as she stood,\\r\\nAnd gave this sentence then;\\r\\nAmong nine bad if one be good,\\r\\nAmong nine bad if one be good,\\r\\nThere's yet one good in ten.\\r\\nCOUNTESS\\r\\nWhat, one good in ten? you corrupt the song, sirrah.\\r\\nClown\\r\\nOne good woman in ten, madam; which is a purifying\\r\\no' the song: would God would serve the world so all\\r\\nthe year! we'ld find no fault with the tithe-woman,\\r\\nif I were the parson. One in ten, quoth a'! An we\\r\\nmight have a good woman born but one every blazing\\r\\nstar, or at an earthquake, 'twould mend the lottery\\r\\nwell: a man may draw his heart out, ere a' pluck\\r\\none.\\r\\nCOUNTESS\\r\\nYou'll be gone, sir knave, and do as I command you.\\r\\nClown\\r\\nThat man should be at woman's command, and yet no\\r\\nhurt done! Though honesty be no puritan, yet it\\r\\nwill do no hurt; it will wear the surplice of\\r\\nhumility over the black gown of a big heart. I am\\r\\ngoing, forsooth: the business is for Helen to come hither.\\r\\nExit\\r\\n\\r\\nCOUNTESS\\r\\nWell, now.\\r\\nSteward\\r\\nI know, madam, you love your gentlewoman entirely.\\r\\nCOUNTESS\\r\\nFaith, I do: her father bequeathed her to me; and\\r\\nshe herself, without other advantage, may lawfully\\r\\nmake title to as much love as she finds: there is\\r\\nmore owing her than is paid; and more shall be paid\\r\\nher than she'll demand.\\r\\nSteward\\r\\nMadam, I was very late more near her than I think\\r\\nshe wished me: alone she was, and did communicate\\r\\nto herself her own words to her own ears; she\\r\\nthought, I dare vow for her, they touched not any\\r\\nstranger sense. Her matter was, she loved your son:\\r\\nFortune, she said, was no goddess, that had put\\r\\nsuch difference betwixt their two estates; Love no\\r\\ngod, that would not extend his might, only where\\r\\nqualities were level; Dian no queen of virgins, that\\r\\nwould suffer her poor knight surprised, without\\r\\nrescue in the first assault or ransom afterward.\\r\\nThis she delivered in the most bitter touch of\\r\\nsorrow that e'er I heard virgin exclaim in: which I\\r\\nheld my duty speedily to acquaint you withal;\\r\\nsithence, in the loss that may happen, it concerns\\r\\nyou something to know it.\\r\\nCOUNTESS\\r\\nYou have discharged this honestly; keep it to\\r\\nyourself: many likelihoods informed me of this\\r\\nbefore, which hung so tottering in the balance that\\r\\nI could neither believe nor misdoubt.

When I said 'a mother,'\\r\\nMethought you saw a serpent: what's in 'mother,'\\r\\nThat you start at it? I say, I am your mother;\\r\\nAnd put you in the catalogue of those\\r\\nThat were enwombed mine: 'tis often seen\\r\\nAdoption strives with nature and choice breeds\\r\\nA native slip to us from foreign seeds:\\r\\nYou ne'er oppress'd me with a mother's groan,\\r\\nYet I express to you a mother's care:\\r\\nGod's mercy, maiden! does it curd thy blood\\r\\nTo say I am thy mother? What's the matter,\\r\\nThat this distemper'd messenger of wet,\\r\\nThe many-colour'd Iris, rounds thine eye?\\r\\nWhy? that you are my daughter?\\r\\nHELENA\\r\\nThat I am not.\\r\\nCOUNTESS\\r\\nI say, I am your mother.\\r\\nHELENA\\r\\nPardon, madam;\\r\\nThe Count Rousillon cannot be my brother:\\r\\nI am from humble, he from honour'd name;\\r\\nNo note upon my parents, his all noble:\\r\\nMy master, my dear lord he is; and I\\r\\nHis servant live, and will his vassal die:\\r\\nHe must not be my brother.\\r\\nCOUNTESS\\r\\nNor I your mother?\\r\\nHELENA\\r\\nYou are my mother, madam; would you were,--\\r\\nSo that my lord your son were not my brother,--\\r\\nIndeed my mother! or were you both our mothers,\\r\\nI care no more for than I do for heaven,\\r\\nSo I were not his sister. Can't no other,\\r\\nBut, I your daughter, he must be my brother?\\r\\nCOUNTESS\\r\\nYes, Helen, you might be my daughter-in-law:\\r\\nGod shield you mean it not! daughter and mother\\r\\nSo strive upon your pulse. What, pale again?\\r\\nMy fear hath catch'd your fondness: now I see\\r\\nThe mystery of your loneliness, and find\\r\\nYour salt tears' head: now to all sense 'tis gross\\r\\nYou love my son; invention is ashamed,\\r\\nAgainst the proclamation of thy passion,\\r\\nTo say thou dost not: therefore tell me true;\\r\\nBut tell me then, 'tis so; for, look thy cheeks\\r\\nConfess it, th' one to th' other; and thine eyes\\r\\nSee it so grossly shown in thy behaviors\\r\\nThat in their kind they speak it: only sin\\r\\nAnd hellish obstinacy tie thy tongue,\\r\\nThat truth should be suspected. Speak, is't so?\\r\\nIf it be so, you have wound a goodly clew;\\r\\nIf it be not, forswear't: howe'er, I charge thee,\\r\\nAs heaven shall work in me for thine avail,\\r\\nTell me truly.\\r\\nHELENA\\r\\nGood madam, pardon me!\\r\\nCOUNTESS\\r\\nDo you love my son?\\r\\nHELENA\\r\\nYour pardon, noble mistress!\\r\\nCOUNTESS\\r\\nLove you my son?\\r\\nHELENA\\r\\nDo not you love him, madam?\\r\\nCOUNTESS\\r\\nGo not about; my love hath in't a bond,\\r\\nWhereof the world takes note: come, come, disclose\\r\\nThe state of your affection; for your passions\\r\\nHave to the full appeach'd.\\r\\nHELENA\\r\\nThen, I confess,\\r\\nHere on my knee, before high heaven and you,\\r\\nThat before you, and next unto high heaven,\\r\\nI love your son.\\r\\nMy friends were poor, but honest; so's my love:\\r\\nBe not offended; for it hurts not him\\r\\nThat he is loved of me: I follow him not\\r\\nBy any token of presumptuous suit;\\r\\nNor would I have him till I do deserve him;\\r\\nYet never know how that desert should be.\\r\\nI know I love in vain, strive against hope;\\r\\nYet in this captious and intenible sieve\\r\\nI still pour in the waters of my love\\r\\nAnd lack not to lose still: thus, Indian-like,\\r\\nReligious in mine error, I adore\\r\\nThe sun, that looks upon his worshipper,\\r\\nBut knows of him no more. My dearest madam,\\r\\nLet not your hate encounter with my love\\r\\nFor loving where you do: but if yourself,\\r\\nWhose aged honour cites a virtuous youth,\\r\\nDid ever in so true a flame of liking\\r\\nWish chastely and love dearly, that your Dian\\r\\nWas both herself and love: O, then, give pity\\r\\nTo her, whose state is such that cannot choose\\r\\nBut lend and give where she is sure to lose;\\r\\nThat seeks not to find that her search implies,\\r\\nBut riddle-like lives sweetly where she dies!\\r\\nCOUNTESS\\r\\nHad you not lately an intent,--speak truly,--\\r\\nTo go to Paris?\\r\\nHELENA\\r\\nMadam, I had.\\r\\nCOUNTESS\\r\\nWherefore? tell true.\\r\\nHELENA\\r\\nI will tell truth; by grace itself I swear.\\r\\nYou know my father left me some prescriptions\\r\\nOf rare and proved effects, such as his reading\\r\\nAnd manifest experience had collected\\r\\nFor general sovereignty; and that he will'd me\\r\\nIn heedfull'st reservation to bestow them,\\r\\nAs notes whose faculties inclusive were\\r\\nMore than they were in note: amongst the rest,\\r\\nThere is a remedy, approved, set down,\\r\\nTo cure the desperate languishings whereof\\r\\nThe king is render'd lost.\\r\\nCOUNTESS\\r\\nThis was your motive\\r\\nFor Paris, was it? speak.\\r\\nHELENA\\r\\nMy lord your son made me to think of this;\\r\\nElse Paris and the medicine and the king\\r\\nHad from the conversation of my thoughts\\r\\nHaply been absent then.\\r\\nCOUNTESS\\r\\nBut think you, Helen,\\r\\nIf you should tender your supposed aid,\\r\\nHe would receive it? he and his physicians\\r\\nAre of a mind; he, that they cannot help him,\\r\\nThey, that they cannot help: how shall they credit\\r\\nA poor unlearned virgin, when the schools,\\r\\nEmbowell'd of their doctrine, have left off\\r\\nThe danger to itself?\\r\\nHELENA\\r\\nThere's something in't,\\r\\nMore than my father's skill, which was the greatest\\r\\nOf his profession, that his good receipt\\r\\nShall for my legacy be sanctified\\r\\nBy the luckiest stars in heaven: and, would your honour\\r\\nBut give me leave to try success, I'ld venture\\r\\nThe well-lost life of mine on his grace's cure\\r\\nBy such a day and hour.\\r\\nCOUNTESS\\r\\nDost thou believe't?\\r\\nHELENA\\r\\nAy, madam, knowingly.\\r\\nCOUNTESS\\r\\nWhy, Helen, thou shalt have my leave and love,\\r\\nMeans and attendants and my loving greetings\\r\\nTo those of mine in court: I'll stay at home\\r\\nAnd pray God's blessing into thy attempt:\\r\\nBe gone to-morrow; and be sure of this,\\r\\nWhat I can help thee to thou shalt not miss.\\r\\nExeunt\\r\\n\\r\\nACT II\\r\\nSCENE I.

The great dignity that his valour hath\\r\\nhere acquired for him shall at home be encountered\\r\\nwith a shame as ample.\\r\\nFirst Lord\\r\\nThe web of our life is of a mingled yarn, good and\\r\\nill together: our virtues would be proud, if our\\r\\nfaults whipped them not; and our crimes would\\r\\ndespair, if they were not cherished by our virtues.\\r\\nEnter a Messenger\\r\\n\\r\\nHow now! where's your master?\\r\\nServant\\r\\nHe met the duke in the street, sir, of whom he hath\\r\\ntaken a solemn leave: his lordship will next\\r\\nmorning for France. The duke hath offered him\\r\\nletters of commendations to the king.\\r\\nSecond Lord\\r\\nThey shall be no more than needful there, if they\\r\\nwere more than they can commend.\\r\\nFirst Lord\\r\\nThey cannot be too sweet for the king's tartness.\\r\\nHere's his lordship now.\\r\\nEnter BERTRAM\\r\\n\\r\\nHow now, my lord! is't not after midnight?\\r\\nBERTRAM\\r\\nI have to-night dispatched sixteen businesses, a\\r\\nmonth's length a-piece, by an abstract of success:\\r\\nI have congied with the duke, done my adieu with his\\r\\nnearest; buried a wife, mourned for her; writ to my\\r\\nlady mother I am returning; entertained my convoy;\\r\\nand between these main parcels of dispatch effected\\r\\nmany nicer needs; the last was the greatest, but\\r\\nthat I have not ended yet.\\r\\nSecond Lord\\r\\nIf the business be of any difficulty, and this\\r\\nmorning your departure hence, it requires haste of\\r\\nyour lordship.\\r\\nBERTRAM\\r\\nI mean, the business is not ended, as fearing to\\r\\nhear of it hereafter. But shall we have this\\r\\ndialogue between the fool and the soldier? Come,\\r\\nbring forth this counterfeit module, he has deceived\\r\\nme, like a double-meaning prophesier.\\r\\nSecond Lord\\r\\nBring him forth: has sat i' the stocks all night,\\r\\npoor gallant knave.\\r\\nBERTRAM\\r\\nNo matter: his heels have deserved it, in usurping\\r\\nhis spurs so long. How does he carry himself?\\r\\nSecond Lord\\r\\nI have told your lordship already, the stocks carry\\r\\nhim. But to answer you as you would be understood;\\r\\nhe weeps like a wench that had shed her milk: he\\r\\nhath confessed himself to Morgan, whom he supposes\\r\\nto be a friar, from the time of his remembrance to\\r\\nthis very instant disaster of his setting i' the\\r\\nstocks: and what think you he hath confessed?\\r\\nBERTRAM\\r\\nNothing of me, has a'?\\r\\nSecond Lord\\r\\nHis confession is taken, and it shall be read to his\\r\\nface: if your lordship be in't, as I believe you\\r\\nare, you must have the patience to hear it.\\r\\nEnter PAROLLES guarded, and First Soldier\\r\\n\\r\\nBERTRAM\\r\\nA plague upon him! muffled! he can say nothing of\\r\\nme: hush, hush!\\r\\nFirst Lord\\r\\nHoodman comes!

What say you to that?\\r\\nPAROLLES\\r\\nFive or six thousand; but very weak and\\r\\nunserviceable: the troops are all scattered, and\\r\\nthe commanders very poor rogues, upon my reputation\\r\\nand credit and as I hope to live.\\r\\nFirst Soldier\\r\\nShall I set down your answer so?\\r\\nPAROLLES\\r\\nDo: I'll take the sacrament on't, how and which way you will.\\r\\nBERTRAM\\r\\nAll's one to him. What a past-saving slave is this!\\r\\nFirst Lord\\r\\nYou're deceived, my lord: this is Monsieur\\r\\nParolles, the gallant militarist,--that was his own\\r\\nphrase,--that had the whole theoric of war in the\\r\\nknot of his scarf, and the practise in the chape of\\r\\nhis dagger.\\r\\nSecond Lord\\r\\nI will never trust a man again for keeping his sword\\r\\nclean. nor believe he can have every thing in him\\r\\nby wearing his apparel neatly.\\r\\nFirst Soldier\\r\\nWell, that's set down.\\r\\nPAROLLES\\r\\nFive or six thousand horse, I said,-- I will say\\r\\ntrue,--or thereabouts, set down, for I'll speak truth.\\r\\nFirst Lord\\r\\nHe's very near the truth in this.\\r\\nBERTRAM\\r\\nBut I con him no thanks for't, in the nature he\\r\\ndelivers it.\\r\\nPAROLLES\\r\\nPoor rogues, I pray you, say.\\r\\nFirst Soldier\\r\\nWell, that's set down.\\r\\nPAROLLES\\r\\nI humbly thank you, sir: a truth's a truth, the\\r\\nrogues are marvellous poor.\\r\\nFirst Soldier\\r\\n[Reads] 'Demand of him, of what strength they are\\r\\na-foot.' What say you to that?\\r\\nPAROLLES\\r\\nBy my troth, sir, if I were to live this present\\r\\nhour, I will tell true. Let me see: Spurio, a\\r\\nhundred and fifty; Sebastian, so many; Corambus, so\\r\\nmany; Jaques, so many; Guiltian, Cosmo, Lodowick,\\r\\nand Gratii, two hundred and fifty each; mine own\\r\\ncompany, Chitopher, Vaumond, Bentii, two hundred and\\r\\nfifty each: so that the muster-file, rotten and\\r\\nsound, upon my life, amounts not to fifteen thousand\\r\\npoll; half of the which dare not shake snow from off\\r\\ntheir cassocks, lest they shake themselves to pieces.\\r\\nBERTRAM\\r\\nWhat shall be done to him?\\r\\nFirst Lord\\r\\nNothing, but let him have thanks. Demand of him my\\r\\ncondition, and what credit I have with the duke.\\r\\nFirst Soldier\\r\\nWell, that's set down.\\r\\nReads\\r\\n\\r\\n'You shall demand of him, whether one Captain Dumain\\r\\nbe i' the camp, a Frenchman; what his reputation is\\r\\nwith the duke; what his valour, honesty, and\\r\\nexpertness in wars; or whether he thinks it were not\\r\\npossible, with well-weighing sums of gold, to\\r\\ncorrupt him to revolt.' What say you to this? what\\r\\ndo you know of it?\\r\\nPAROLLES\\r\\nI beseech you, let me answer to the particular of\\r\\nthe inter'gatories: demand them singly.\\r\\nFirst Soldier\\r\\nDo you know this Captain Dumain?\\r\\nPAROLLES\\r\\nI know him: a' was a botcher's 'prentice in Paris,\\r\\nfrom whence he was whipped for getting the shrieve's\\r\\nfool with child,--a dumb innocent, that could not\\r\\nsay him nay.\\r\\nBERTRAM\\r\\nNay, by your leave, hold your hands; though I know\\r\\nhis brains are forfeit to the next tile that falls.\\r\\nFirst Soldier\\r\\nWell, is this captain in the duke of Florence's camp?\\r\\nPAROLLES\\r\\nUpon my knowledge, he is, and lousy.\\r\\nFirst Lord\\r\\nNay look not so upon me; we shall hear of your\\r\\nlordship anon.\\r\\nFirst Soldier\\r\\nWhat is his reputation with the duke?\\r\\nPAROLLES\\r\\nThe duke knows him for no other but a poor officer\\r\\nof mine; and writ to me this other day to turn him\\r\\nout o' the band: I think I have his letter in my pocket.\\r\\nFirst Soldier\\r\\nMarry, we'll search.\\r\\nPAROLLES\\r\\nIn good sadness, I do not know; either it is there,\\r\\nor it is upon a file with the duke's other letters\\r\\nin my tent.\\r\\nFirst Soldier\\r\\nHere 'tis; here's a paper: shall I read it to you?\\r\\nPAROLLES\\r\\nI do not know if it be it or no.\\r\\nBERTRAM\\r\\nOur interpreter does it well.\\r\\nFirst Lord\\r\\nExcellently.\\r\\nFirst Soldier\\r\\n[Reads] 'Dian, the count's a fool, and full of gold,'--\\r\\nPAROLLES\\r\\nThat is not the duke's letter, sir; that is an\\r\\nadvertisement to a proper maid in Florence, one\\r\\nDiana, to take heed of the allurement of one Count\\r\\nRousillon, a foolish idle boy, but for all that very\\r\\nruttish: I pray you, sir, put it up again.\\r\\nFirst Soldier\\r\\nNay, I'll read it first, by your favour.\\r\\nPAROLLES\\r\\nMy meaning in't, I protest, was very honest in the\\r\\nbehalf of the maid; for I knew the young count to be\\r\\na dangerous and lascivious boy, who is a whale to\\r\\nvirginity and devours up all the fry it finds.\\r\\nBERTRAM\\r\\nDamnable both-sides rogue!\\r\\nFirst Soldier\\r\\n[Reads] 'When he swears oaths, bid him drop gold, and take it;\\r\\nAfter he scores, he never pays the score:\\r\\nHalf won is match well made; match, and well make it;\\r\\nHe ne'er pays after-debts, take it before;\\r\\nAnd say a soldier, Dian, told thee this,\\r\\nMen are to mell with, boys are not to kiss:\\r\\nFor count of this, the count's a fool, I know it,\\r\\nWho pays before, but not when he does owe it.\\r\\nThine, as he vowed to thee in thine ear,\\r\\nPAROLLES.'\\r\\nBERTRAM\\r\\nHe shall be whipped through the army with this rhyme\\r\\nin's forehead.\\r\\nSecond Lord\\r\\nThis is your devoted friend, sir, the manifold\\r\\nlinguist and the armipotent soldier.\\r\\nBERTRAM\\r\\nI could endure any thing before but a cat, and now\\r\\nhe's a cat to me.\\r\\nFirst Soldier\\r\\nI perceive, sir, by the general's looks, we shall be\\r\\nfain to hang you.\\r\\nPAROLLES\\r\\nMy life, sir, in any case: not that I am afraid to\\r\\ndie; but that, my offences being many, I would\\r\\nrepent out the remainder of nature: let me live,\\r\\nsir, in a dungeon, i' the stocks, or any where, so I may live.\\r\\nFirst Soldier\\r\\nWe'll see what may be done, so you confess freely;\\r\\ntherefore, once more to this Captain Dumain: you\\r\\nhave answered to his reputation with the duke and to\\r\\nhis valour: what is his honesty?\\r\\nPAROLLES\\r\\nHe will steal, sir, an egg out of a cloister: for\\r\\nrapes and ravishments he parallels Nessus: he\\r\\nprofesses not keeping of oaths; in breaking 'em he\\r\\nis stronger than Hercules: he will lie, sir, with\\r\\nsuch volubility, that you would think truth were a\\r\\nfool: drunkenness is his best virtue, for he will\\r\\nbe swine-drunk; and in his sleep he does little\\r\\nharm, save to his bed-clothes about him; but they\\r\\nknow his conditions and lay him in straw. I have but\\r\\nlittle more to say, sir, of his honesty: he has\\r\\nevery thing that an honest man should not have; what\\r\\nan honest man should have, he has nothing.\\r\\nFirst Lord\\r\\nI begin to love him for this.\\r\\nBERTRAM\\r\\nFor this description of thine honesty?

Enter KING, COUNTESS, LAFEU, the two French Lords, with Attendants\\r\\nKING\\r\\nWe lost a jewel of her; and our esteem\\r\\nWas made much poorer by it: but your son,\\r\\nAs mad in folly, lack'd the sense to know\\r\\nHer estimation home.\\r\\nCOUNTESS\\r\\n'Tis past, my liege;\\r\\nAnd I beseech your majesty to make it\\r\\nNatural rebellion, done i' the blaze of youth;\\r\\nWhen oil and fire, too strong for reason's force,\\r\\nO'erbears it and burns on.\\r\\nKING\\r\\nMy honour'd lady,\\r\\nI have forgiven and forgotten all;\\r\\nThough my revenges were high bent upon him,\\r\\nAnd watch'd the time to shoot.\\r\\nLAFEU\\r\\nThis I must say,\\r\\nBut first I beg my pardon, the young lord\\r\\nDid to his majesty, his mother and his lady\\r\\nOffence of mighty note; but to himself\\r\\nThe greatest wrong of all. He lost a wife\\r\\nWhose beauty did astonish the survey\\r\\nOf richest eyes, whose words all ears took captive,\\r\\nWhose dear perfection hearts that scorn'd to serve\\r\\nHumbly call'd mistress.\\r\\nKING\\r\\nPraising what is lost\\r\\nMakes the remembrance dear. Well, call him hither;\\r\\nWe are reconciled, and the first view shall kill\\r\\nAll repetition: let him not ask our pardon;\\r\\nThe nature of his great offence is dead,\\r\\nAnd deeper than oblivion we do bury\\r\\nThe incensing relics of it: let him approach,\\r\\nA stranger, no offender; and inform him\\r\\nSo 'tis our will he should.\\r\\nGentleman\\r\\nI shall, my liege.\\r\\nExit\\r\\n\\r\\nKING\\r\\nWhat says he to your daughter? have you spoke?\\r\\nLAFEU\\r\\nAll that he is hath reference to your highness.\\r\\nKING\\r\\nThen shall we have a match. I have letters sent me\\r\\nThat set him high in fame.\\r\\nEnter BERTRAM\\r\\n\\r\\nLAFEU\\r\\nHe looks well on't.\\r\\nKING\\r\\nI am not a day of season,\\r\\nFor thou mayst see a sunshine and a hail\\r\\nIn me at once: but to the brightest beams\\r\\nDistracted clouds give way; so stand thou forth;\\r\\nThe time is fair again.\\r\\nBERTRAM\\r\\nMy high-repented blames,\\r\\nDear sovereign, pardon to me.\\r\\nKING\\r\\nAll is whole;\\r\\nNot one word more of the consumed time.\\r\\nLet's take the instant by the forward top;\\r\\nFor we are old, and on our quick'st decrees\\r\\nThe inaudible and noiseless foot of Time\\r\\nSteals ere we can effect them. You remember\\r\\nThe daughter of this lord?\\r\\nBERTRAM\\r\\nAdmiringly, my liege, at first\\r\\nI stuck my choice upon her, ere my heart\\r\\nDurst make too bold a herald of my tongue\\r\\nWhere the impression of mine eye infixing,\\r\\nContempt his scornful perspective did lend me,\\r\\nWhich warp'd the line of every other favour;\\r\\nScorn'd a fair colour, or express'd it stolen;\\r\\nExtended or contracted all proportions\\r\\nTo a most hideous object: thence it came\\r\\nThat she whom all men praised and whom myself,\\r\\nSince I have lost, have loved, was in mine eye\\r\\nThe dust that did offend it.\\r\\nKING\\r\\nWell excused:\\r\\nThat thou didst love her, strikes some scores away\\r\\nFrom the great compt: but love that comes too late,\\r\\nLike a remorseful pardon slowly carried,\\r\\nTo the great sender turns a sour offence,\\r\\nCrying, 'That's good that's gone.'

Had you that craft, to reave\\r\\nher\\r\\nOf what should stead her most?\\r\\nBERTRAM\\r\\nMy gracious sovereign,\\r\\nHowe'er it pleases you to take it so,\\r\\nThe ring was never hers.\\r\\nCOUNTESS\\r\\nSon, on my life,\\r\\nI have seen her wear it; and she reckon'd it\\r\\nAt her life's rate.\\r\\nLAFEU\\r\\nI am sure I saw her wear it.\\r\\nBERTRAM\\r\\nYou are deceived, my lord; she never saw it:\\r\\nIn Florence was it from a casement thrown me,\\r\\nWrapp'd in a paper, which contain'd the name\\r\\nOf her that threw it: noble she was, and thought\\r\\nI stood engaged: but when I had subscribed\\r\\nTo mine own fortune and inform'd her fully\\r\\nI could not answer in that course of honour\\r\\nAs she had made the overture, she ceased\\r\\nIn heavy satisfaction and would never\\r\\nReceive the ring again.\\r\\nKING\\r\\nPlutus himself,\\r\\nThat knows the tinct and multiplying medicine,\\r\\nHath not in nature's mystery more science\\r\\nThan I have in this ring: 'twas mine, 'twas Helen's,\\r\\nWhoever gave it you. Then, if you know\\r\\nThat you are well acquainted with yourself,\\r\\nConfess 'twas hers, and by what rough enforcement\\r\\nYou got it from her: she call'd the saints to surety\\r\\nThat she would never put it from her finger,\\r\\nUnless she gave it to yourself in bed,\\r\\nWhere you have never come, or sent it us\\r\\nUpon her great disaster.\\r\\nBERTRAM\\r\\nShe never saw it.\\r\\nKING\\r\\nThou speak'st it falsely, as I love mine honour;\\r\\nAnd makest conjectural fears to come into me\\r\\nWhich I would fain shut out. If it should prove\\r\\nThat thou art so inhuman,--'twill not prove so;--\\r\\nAnd yet I know not: thou didst hate her deadly,\\r\\nAnd she is dead; which nothing, but to close\\r\\nHer eyes myself, could win me to believe,\\r\\nMore than to see this ring. Take him away.\\r\\nGuards seize BERTRAM\\r\\n\\r\\nMy fore-past proofs, howe'er the matter fall,\\r\\nShall tax my fears of little vanity,\\r\\nHaving vainly fear'd too little. Away with him!\\r\\nWe'll sift this matter further.\\r\\nBERTRAM\\r\\nIf you shall prove\\r\\nThis ring was ever hers, you shall as easy\\r\\nProve that I husbanded her bed in Florence,\\r\\nWhere yet she never was.\\r\\nExit, guarded\\r\\n\\r\\nKING\\r\\nI am wrapp'd in dismal thinkings.\\r\\nEnter a Gentleman\\r\\n\\r\\nGentleman\\r\\nGracious sovereign,\\r\\nWhether I have been to blame or no, I know not:\\r\\nHere's a petition from a Florentine,\\r\\nWho hath for four or five removes come short\\r\\nTo tender it herself. I undertook it,\\r\\nVanquish'd thereto by the fair grace and speech\\r\\nOf the poor suppliant, who by this I know\\r\\nIs here attending: her business looks in her\\r\\nWith an importing visage; and she told me,\\r\\nIn a sweet verbal brief, it did concern\\r\\nYour highness with herself.\\r\\nKING\\r\\n[Reads] Upon his many protestations to marry me\\r\\nwhen his wife was dead, I blush to say it, he won\\r\\nme. Now is the Count Rousillon a widower: his vows\\r\\nare forfeited to me, and my honour's paid to him. He\\r\\nstole from Florence, taking no leave, and I follow\\r\\nhim to his country for justice: grant it me, O\\r\\nking! in you it best lies; otherwise a seducer\\r\\nflourishes, and a poor maid is undone.\\r\\nDIANA CAPILET.\\r\\nLAFEU\\r\\nI will buy me a son-in-law in a fair, and toll for\\r\\nthis: I'll none of him.\\r\\nKING\\r\\nThe heavens have thought well on thee Lafeu,\\r\\nTo bring forth this discovery.

Orchard of Oliver's house.\\r\\nEnter ORLANDO and ADAM\\r\\nORLANDO\\r\\nAs I remember, Adam, it was upon this fashion\\r\\nbequeathed me by will but poor a thousand crowns,\\r\\nand, as thou sayest, charged my brother, on his\\r\\nblessing, to breed me well: and there begins my\\r\\nsadness. My brother Jaques he keeps at school, and\\r\\nreport speaks goldenly of his profit: for my part,\\r\\nhe keeps me rustically at home, or, to speak more\\r\\nproperly, stays me here at home unkept; for call you\\r\\nthat keeping for a gentleman of my birth, that\\r\\ndiffers not from the stalling of an ox? His horses\\r\\nare bred better; for, besides that they are fair\\r\\nwith their feeding, they are taught their manage,\\r\\nand to that end riders dearly hired: but I, his\\r\\nbrother, gain nothing under him but growth; for the\\r\\nwhich his animals on his dunghills are as much\\r\\nbound to him as I. Besides this nothing that he so\\r\\nplentifully gives me, the something that nature gave\\r\\nme his countenance seems to take from me: he lets\\r\\nme feed with his hinds, bars me the place of a\\r\\nbrother, and, as much as in him lies, mines my\\r\\ngentility with my education. This is it, Adam, that\\r\\ngrieves me; and the spirit of my father, which I\\r\\nthink is within me, begins to mutiny against this\\r\\nservitude: I will no longer endure it, though yet I\\r\\nknow no wise remedy how to avoid it.\\r\\nADAM\\r\\nYonder comes my master, your brother.\\r\\nORLANDO\\r\\nGo apart, Adam, and thou shalt hear how he will\\r\\nshake me up.\\r\\nEnter OLIVER\\r\\n\\r\\nOLIVER\\r\\nNow, sir! what make you here?\\r\\nORLANDO\\r\\nNothing: I am not taught to make any thing.\\r\\nOLIVER\\r\\nWhat mar you then, sir?\\r\\nORLANDO\\r\\nMarry, sir, I am helping you to mar that which God\\r\\nmade, a poor unworthy brother of yours, with idleness.\\r\\nOLIVER\\r\\nMarry, sir, be better employed, and be naught awhile.\\r\\nORLANDO\\r\\nShall I keep your hogs and eat husks with them?\\r\\nWhat prodigal portion have I spent, that I should\\r\\ncome to such penury?\\r\\nOLIVER\\r\\nKnow you where your are, sir?\\r\\nORLANDO\\r\\nO, sir, very well; here in your orchard.\\r\\nOLIVER\\r\\nKnow you before whom, sir?\\r\\nORLANDO\\r\\nAy, better than him I am before knows me. I know\\r\\nyou are my eldest brother; and, in the gentle\\r\\ncondition of blood, you should so know me. The\\r\\ncourtesy of nations allows you my better, in that\\r\\nyou are the first-born; but the same tradition\\r\\ntakes not away my blood, were there twenty brothers\\r\\nbetwixt us: I have as much of my father in me as\\r\\nyou; albeit, I confess, your coming before me is\\r\\nnearer to his reverence.\\r\\nOLIVER\\r\\nWhat, boy!\\r\\nORLANDO\\r\\nCome, come, elder brother, you are too young in this.\\r\\nOLIVER\\r\\nWilt thou lay hands on me, villain?\\r\\nORLANDO\\r\\nI am no villain; I am the youngest son of Sir\\r\\nRowland de Boys; he was my father, and he is thrice\\r\\na villain that says such a father begot villains.\\r\\nWert thou not my brother, I would not take this hand\\r\\nfrom thy throat till this other had pulled out thy\\r\\ntongue for saying so: thou hast railed on thyself.\\r\\nADAM\\r\\nSweet masters, be patient: for your father's\\r\\nremembrance, be at accord.\\r\\nOLIVER\\r\\nLet me go, I say.\\r\\nORLANDO\\r\\nI will not, till I please: you shall hear me. My\\r\\nfather charged you in his will to give me good\\r\\neducation: you have trained me like a peasant,\\r\\nobscuring and hiding from me all gentleman-like\\r\\nqualities. The spirit of my father grows strong in\\r\\nme, and I will no longer endure it: therefore allow\\r\\nme such exercises as may become a gentleman, or\\r\\ngive me the poor allottery my father left me by\\r\\ntestament; with that I will go buy my fortunes.\\r\\nOLIVER\\r\\nAnd what wilt thou do? beg, when that is spent?\\r\\nWell, sir, get you in: I will not long be troubled\\r\\nwith you; you shall have some part of your will: I\\r\\npray you, leave me.\\r\\nORLANDO\\r\\nI will no further offend you than becomes me for my good.\\r\\nOLIVER\\r\\nGet you with him, you old dog.\\r\\nADAM\\r\\nIs 'old dog' my reward? Most true, I have lost my\\r\\nteeth in your service. God be with my old master!\\r\\nhe would not have spoke such a word.\\r\\nExeunt ORLANDO and ADAM\\r\\n\\r\\nOLIVER\\r\\nIs it even so? begin you to grow upon me? I will\\r\\nphysic your rankness, and yet give no thousand\\r\\ncrowns neither. Holla, Dennis!\\r\\nEnter DENNIS\\r\\n\\r\\nDENNIS\\r\\nCalls your worship?\\r\\nOLIVER\\r\\nWas not Charles, the duke's wrestler, here to speak with me?\\r\\nDENNIS\\r\\nSo please you, he is here at the door and importunes\\r\\naccess to you.\\r\\nOLIVER\\r\\nCall him in.\\r\\nExit DENNIS\\r\\n\\r\\n'Twill be a good way; and to-morrow the wrestling is.\\r\\nEnter CHARLES\\r\\n\\r\\nCHARLES\\r\\nGood morrow to your worship.\\r\\nOLIVER\\r\\nGood Monsieur Charles, what's the new news at the\\r\\nnew court?\\r\\nCHARLES\\r\\nThere's no news at the court, sir, but the old news:\\r\\nthat is, the old duke is banished by his younger\\r\\nbrother the new duke; and three or four loving lords\\r\\nhave put themselves into voluntary exile with him,\\r\\nwhose lands and revenues enrich the new duke;\\r\\ntherefore he gives them good leave to wander.\\r\\nOLIVER\\r\\nCan you tell if Rosalind, the duke's daughter, be\\r\\nbanished with her father?\\r\\nCHARLES\\r\\nO, no; for the duke's daughter, her cousin, so loves\\r\\nher, being ever from their cradles bred together,\\r\\nthat she would have followed her exile, or have died\\r\\nto stay behind her. She is at the court, and no\\r\\nless beloved of her uncle than his own daughter; and\\r\\nnever two ladies loved as they do.\\r\\nOLIVER\\r\\nWhere will the old duke live?\\r\\nCHARLES\\r\\nThey say he is already in the forest of Arden, and\\r\\na many merry men with him; and there they live like\\r\\nthe old Robin Hood of England: they say many young\\r\\ngentlemen flock to him every day, and fleet the time\\r\\ncarelessly, as they did in the golden world.\\r\\nOLIVER\\r\\nWhat, you wrestle to-morrow before the new duke?\\r\\nCHARLES\\r\\nMarry, do I, sir; and I came to acquaint you with a\\r\\nmatter. I am given, sir, secretly to understand\\r\\nthat your younger brother Orlando hath a disposition\\r\\nto come in disguised against me to try a fall.\\r\\nTo-morrow, sir, I wrestle for my credit; and he that\\r\\nescapes me without some broken limb shall acquit him\\r\\nwell. Your brother is but young and tender; and,\\r\\nfor your love, I would be loath to foil him, as I\\r\\nmust, for my own honour, if he come in: therefore,\\r\\nout of my love to you, I came hither to acquaint you\\r\\nwithal, that either you might stay him from his\\r\\nintendment or brook such disgrace well as he shall\\r\\nrun into, in that it is a thing of his own search\\r\\nand altogether against my will.\\r\\nOLIVER\\r\\nCharles, I thank thee for thy love to me, which\\r\\nthou shalt find I will most kindly requite. I had\\r\\nmyself notice of my brother's purpose herein and\\r\\nhave by underhand means laboured to dissuade him from\\r\\nit, but he is resolute. I'll tell thee, Charles:\\r\\nit is the stubbornest young fellow of France, full\\r\\nof ambition, an envious emulator of every man's\\r\\ngood parts, a secret and villanous contriver against\\r\\nme his natural brother: therefore use thy\\r\\ndiscretion; I had as lief thou didst break his neck\\r\\nas his finger. And thou wert best look to't; for if\\r\\nthou dost him any slight disgrace or if he do not\\r\\nmightily grace himself on thee, he will practise\\r\\nagainst thee by poison, entrap thee by some\\r\\ntreacherous device and never leave thee till he\\r\\nhath ta'en thy life by some indirect means or other;\\r\\nfor, I assure thee, and almost with tears I speak\\r\\nit, there is not one so young and so villanous this\\r\\nday living. I speak but brotherly of him; but\\r\\nshould I anatomize him to thee as he is, I must\\r\\nblush and weep and thou must look pale and wonder.\\r\\nCHARLES\\r\\nI am heartily glad I came hither to you. If he come\\r\\nto-morrow, I'll give him his payment: if ever he go\\r\\nalone again, I'll never wrestle for prize more: and\\r\\nso God keep your worship!\\r\\nOLIVER\\r\\nFarewell, good Charles.\\r\\nExit CHARLES\\r\\n\\r\\nNow will I stir this gamester: I hope I shall see\\r\\nan end of him; for my soul, yet I know not why,\\r\\nhates nothing more than he. Yet he's gentle, never\\r\\nschooled and yet learned, full of noble device, of\\r\\nall sorts enchantingly beloved, and indeed so much\\r\\nin the heart of the world, and especially of my own\\r\\npeople, who best know him, that I am altogether\\r\\nmisprised: but it shall not be so long; this\\r\\nwrestler shall clear all: nothing remains but that\\r\\nI kindle the boy thither; which now I'll go about.\\r\\nExit\\r\\n\\r\\nSCENE II. Lawn before the Duke's palace.\\r\\nEnter CELIA and ROSALIND\\r\\nCELIA\\r\\nI pray thee, Rosalind, sweet my coz, be merry.\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nDear Celia, I show more mirth than I am mistress of;\\r\\nand would you yet I were merrier? Unless you could\\r\\nteach me to forget a banished father, you must not\\r\\nlearn me how to remember any extraordinary pleasure.\\r\\nCELIA\\r\\nHerein I see thou lovest me not with the full weight\\r\\nthat I love thee. If my uncle, thy banished father,\\r\\nhad banished thy uncle, the duke my father, so thou\\r\\nhadst been still with me, I could have taught my\\r\\nlove to take thy father for mine: so wouldst thou,\\r\\nif the truth of thy love to me were so righteously\\r\\ntempered as mine is to thee.\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nWell, I will forget the condition of my estate, to\\r\\nrejoice in yours.\\r\\nCELIA\\r\\nYou know my father hath no child but I, nor none is\\r\\nlike to have: and, truly, when he dies, thou shalt\\r\\nbe his heir, for what he hath taken away from thy\\r\\nfather perforce, I will render thee again in\\r\\naffection; by mine honour, I will; and when I break\\r\\nthat oath, let me turn monster: therefore, my\\r\\nsweet Rose, my dear Rose, be merry.\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nFrom henceforth I will, coz, and devise sports. Let\\r\\nme see; what think you of falling in love?\\r\\nCELIA\\r\\nMarry, I prithee, do, to make sport withal: but\\r\\nlove no man in good earnest; nor no further in sport\\r\\nneither than with safety of a pure blush thou mayst\\r\\nin honour come off again.\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nWhat shall be our sport, then?\\r\\nCELIA\\r\\nLet us sit and mock the good housewife Fortune from\\r\\nher wheel, that her gifts may henceforth be bestowed equally.\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nI would we could do so, for her benefits are\\r\\nmightily misplaced, and the bountiful blind woman\\r\\ndoth most mistake in her gifts to women.\\r\\nCELIA\\r\\n'Tis true; for those that she makes fair she scarce\\r\\nmakes honest, and those that she makes honest she\\r\\nmakes very ill-favouredly.\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nNay, now thou goest from Fortune's office to\\r\\nNature's: Fortune reigns in gifts of the world,\\r\\nnot in the lineaments of Nature.\\r\\nEnter TOUCHSTONE\\r\\n\\r\\nCELIA\\r\\nNo? when Nature hath made a fair creature, may she\\r\\nnot by Fortune fall into the fire? Though Nature\\r\\nhath given us wit to flout at Fortune, hath not\\r\\nFortune sent in this fool to cut off the argument?\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nIndeed, there is Fortune too hard for Nature, when\\r\\nFortune makes Nature's natural the cutter-off of\\r\\nNature's wit.\\r\\nCELIA\\r\\nPeradventure this is not Fortune's work neither, but\\r\\nNature's; who perceiveth our natural wits too dull\\r\\nto reason of such goddesses and hath sent this\\r\\nnatural for our whetstone; for always the dulness of\\r\\nthe fool is the whetstone of the wits. How now,\\r\\nwit! whither wander you?\\r\\nTOUCHSTONE\\r\\nMistress, you must come away to your father.\\r\\nCELIA\\r\\nWere you made the messenger?\\r\\nTOUCHSTONE\\r\\nNo, by mine honour, but I was bid to come for you.\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nWhere learned you that oath, fool?\\r\\nTOUCHSTONE\\r\\nOf a certain knight that swore by his honour they\\r\\nwere good pancakes and swore by his honour the\\r\\nmustard was naught: now I'll stand to it, the\\r\\npancakes were naught and the mustard was good, and\\r\\nyet was not the knight forsworn.\\r\\nCELIA\\r\\nHow prove you that, in the great heap of your\\r\\nknowledge?\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nAy, marry, now unmuzzle your wisdom.\\r\\nTOUCHSTONE\\r\\nStand you both forth now: stroke your chins, and\\r\\nswear by your beards that I am a knave.\\r\\nCELIA\\r\\nBy our beards, if we had them, thou art.\\r\\nTOUCHSTONE\\r\\nBy my knavery, if I had it, then I were; but if you\\r\\nswear by that that is not, you are not forsworn: no\\r\\nmore was this knight swearing by his honour, for he\\r\\nnever had any; or if he had, he had sworn it away\\r\\nbefore ever he saw those pancakes or that mustard.\\r\\nCELIA\\r\\nPrithee, who is't that thou meanest?\\r\\nTOUCHSTONE\\r\\nOne that old Frederick, your father, loves.\\r\\nCELIA\\r\\nMy father's love is enough to honour him: enough!\\r\\nspeak no more of him; you'll be whipped for taxation\\r\\none of these days.\\r\\nTOUCHSTONE\\r\\nThe more pity, that fools may not speak wisely what\\r\\nwise men do foolishly.\\r\\nCELIA\\r\\nBy my troth, thou sayest true; for since the little\\r\\nwit that fools have was silenced, the little foolery\\r\\nthat wise men have makes a great show. Here comes\\r\\nMonsieur Le Beau.\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nWith his mouth full of news.\\r\\nCELIA\\r\\nWhich he will put on us, as pigeons feed their young.\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nThen shall we be news-crammed.\\r\\nCELIA\\r\\nAll the better; we shall be the more marketable.\\r\\nEnter LE BEAU\\r\\n\\r\\nBon jour, Monsieur Le Beau: what's the news?\\r\\nLE BEAU\\r\\nFair princess, you have lost much good sport.\\r\\nCELIA\\r\\nSport! of what colour?\\r\\nLE BEAU\\r\\nWhat colour, madam! how shall I answer you?\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nAs wit and fortune will.\\r\\nTOUCHSTONE\\r\\nOr as the Destinies decree.\\r\\nCELIA\\r\\nWell said: that was laid on with a trowel.\\r\\nTOUCHSTONE\\r\\nNay, if I keep not my rank,--\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nThou losest thy old smell.\\r\\nLE BEAU\\r\\nYou amaze me, ladies: I would have told you of good\\r\\nwrestling, which you have lost the sight of.\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nYou tell us the manner of the wrestling.\\r\\nLE BEAU\\r\\nI will tell you the beginning; and, if it please\\r\\nyour ladyships, you may see the end; for the best is\\r\\nyet to do; and here, where you are, they are coming\\r\\nto perform it.\\r\\nCELIA\\r\\nWell, the beginning, that is dead and buried.\\r\\nLE BEAU\\r\\nThere comes an old man and his three sons,--\\r\\nCELIA\\r\\nI could match this beginning with an old tale.\\r\\nLE BEAU\\r\\nThree proper young men, of excellent growth and presence.\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nWith bills on their necks, 'Be it known unto all men\\r\\nby these presents.'\\r\\nLE BEAU\\r\\nThe eldest of the three wrestled with Charles, the\\r\\nduke's wrestler; which Charles in a moment threw him\\r\\nand broke three of his ribs, that there is little\\r\\nhope of life in him: so he served the second, and\\r\\nso the third. Yonder they lie; the poor old man,\\r\\ntheir father, making such pitiful dole over them\\r\\nthat all the beholders take his part with weeping.\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nAlas!\\r\\nTOUCHSTONE\\r\\nBut what is the sport, monsieur, that the ladies\\r\\nhave lost?\\r\\nLE BEAU\\r\\nWhy, this that I speak of.\\r\\nTOUCHSTONE\\r\\nThus men may grow wiser every day: it is the first\\r\\ntime that ever I heard breaking of ribs was sport\\r\\nfor ladies.\\r\\nCELIA\\r\\nOr I, I promise thee.\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nBut is there any else longs to see this broken music\\r\\nin his sides? is there yet another dotes upon\\r\\nrib-breaking? Shall we see this wrestling, cousin?\\r\\nLE BEAU\\r\\nYou must, if you stay here; for here is the place\\r\\nappointed for the wrestling, and they are ready to\\r\\nperform it.\\r\\nCELIA\\r\\nYonder, sure, they are coming: let us now stay and see it.\\r\\nFlourish. Enter DUKE FREDERICK, Lords, ORLANDO, CHARLES, and Attendants\\r\\n\\r\\nDUKE FREDERICK\\r\\nCome on: since the youth will not be entreated, his\\r\\nown peril on his forwardness.\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nIs yonder the man?\\r\\nLE BEAU\\r\\nEven he, madam.\\r\\nCELIA\\r\\nAlas, he is too young! yet he looks successfully.\\r\\nDUKE FREDERICK\\r\\nHow now, daughter and cousin! are you crept hither\\r\\nto see the wrestling?\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nAy, my liege, so please you give us leave.\\r\\nDUKE FREDERICK\\r\\nYou will take little delight in it, I can tell you;\\r\\nthere is such odds in the man. In pity of the\\r\\nchallenger's youth I would fain dissuade him, but he\\r\\nwill not be entreated. Speak to him, ladies; see if\\r\\nyou can move him.\\r\\nCELIA\\r\\nCall him hither, good Monsieur Le Beau.\\r\\nDUKE FREDERICK\\r\\nDo so: I'll not be by.\\r\\nLE BEAU\\r\\nMonsieur the challenger, the princesses call for you.\\r\\nORLANDO\\r\\nI attend them with all respect and duty.\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nYoung man, have you challenged Charles the wrestler?\\r\\nORLANDO\\r\\nNo, fair princess; he is the general challenger: I\\r\\ncome but in, as others do, to try with him the\\r\\nstrength of my youth.\\r\\nCELIA\\r\\nYoung gentleman, your spirits are too bold for your\\r\\nyears. You have seen cruel proof of this man's\\r\\nstrength: if you saw yourself with your eyes or\\r\\nknew yourself with your judgment, the fear of your\\r\\nadventure would counsel you to a more equal\\r\\nenterprise. We pray you, for your own sake, to\\r\\nembrace your own safety and give over this attempt.\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nDo, young sir; your reputation shall not therefore\\r\\nbe misprised: we will make it our suit to the duke\\r\\nthat the wrestling might not go forward.\\r\\nORLANDO\\r\\nI beseech you, punish me not with your hard\\r\\nthoughts; wherein I confess me much guilty, to deny\\r\\nso fair and excellent ladies any thing. But let\\r\\nyour fair eyes and gentle wishes go with me to my\\r\\ntrial: wherein if I be foiled, there is but one\\r\\nshamed that was never gracious; if killed, but one\\r\\ndead that was willing to be so: I shall do my\\r\\nfriends no wrong, for I have none to lament me, the\\r\\nworld no injury, for in it I have nothing; only in\\r\\nthe world I fill up a place, which may be better\\r\\nsupplied when I have made it empty.\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nThe little strength that I have, I would it were with you.\\r\\nCELIA\\r\\nAnd mine, to eke out hers.\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nFare you well: pray heaven I be deceived in you!\\r\\nCELIA\\r\\nYour heart's desires be with you!\\r\\nCHARLES\\r\\nCome, where is this young gallant that is so\\r\\ndesirous to lie with his mother earth?\\r\\nORLANDO\\r\\nReady, sir; but his will hath in it a more modest working.\\r\\nDUKE FREDERICK\\r\\nYou shall try but one fall.\\r\\nCHARLES\\r\\nNo, I warrant your grace, you shall not entreat him\\r\\nto a second, that have so mightily persuaded him\\r\\nfrom a first.\\r\\nORLANDO\\r\\nAn you mean to mock me after, you should not have\\r\\nmocked me before: but come your ways.\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nNow Hercules be thy speed, young man!\\r\\nCELIA\\r\\nI would I were invisible, to catch the strong\\r\\nfellow by the leg.\\r\\nThey wrestle\\r\\n\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nO excellent young man!\\r\\nCELIA\\r\\nIf I had a thunderbolt in mine eye, I can tell who\\r\\nshould down.\\r\\nShout. CHARLES is thrown\\r\\n\\r\\nDUKE FREDERICK\\r\\nNo more, no more.\\r\\nORLANDO\\r\\nYes, I beseech your grace: I am not yet well breathed.\\r\\nDUKE FREDERICK\\r\\nHow dost thou, Charles?\\r\\nLE BEAU\\r\\nHe cannot speak, my lord.\\r\\nDUKE FREDERICK\\r\\nBear him away. What is thy name, young man?\\r\\nORLANDO\\r\\nOrlando, my liege; the youngest son of Sir Rowland de Boys.\\r\\nDUKE FREDERICK\\r\\nI would thou hadst been son to some man else:\\r\\nThe world esteem'd thy father honourable,\\r\\nBut I did find him still mine enemy:\\r\\nThou shouldst have better pleased me with this deed,\\r\\nHadst thou descended from another house.\\r\\nBut fare thee well; thou art a gallant youth:\\r\\nI would thou hadst told me of another father.\\r\\nExeunt DUKE FREDERICK, train, and LE BEAU\\r\\n\\r\\nCELIA\\r\\nWere I my father, coz, would I do this?\\r\\nORLANDO\\r\\nI am more proud to be Sir Rowland's son,\\r\\nHis youngest son; and would not change that calling,\\r\\nTo be adopted heir to Frederick.\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nMy father loved Sir Rowland as his soul,\\r\\nAnd all the world was of my father's mind:\\r\\nHad I before known this young man his son,\\r\\nI should have given him tears unto entreaties,\\r\\nEre he should thus have ventured.\\r\\nCELIA\\r\\nGentle cousin,\\r\\nLet us go thank him and encourage him:\\r\\nMy father's rough and envious disposition\\r\\nSticks me at heart. Sir, you have well deserved:\\r\\nIf you do keep your promises in love\\r\\nBut justly, as you have exceeded all promise,\\r\\nYour mistress shall be happy.\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nGentleman,\\r\\nGiving him a chain from her neck\\r\\n\\r\\nWear this for me, one out of suits with fortune,\\r\\nThat could give more, but that her hand lacks means.\\r\\nShall we go, coz?\\r\\nCELIA\\r\\nAy. Fare you well, fair gentleman.\\r\\nORLANDO\\r\\nCan I not say, I thank you? My better parts\\r\\nAre all thrown down, and that which here stands up\\r\\nIs but a quintain, a mere lifeless block.\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nHe calls us back: my pride fell with my fortunes;\\r\\nI'll ask him what he would. Did you call, sir?\\r\\nSir, you have wrestled well and overthrown\\r\\nMore than your enemies.\\r\\nCELIA\\r\\nWill you go, coz?\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nHave with you. Fare you well.\\r\\nExeunt ROSALIND and CELIA\\r\\n\\r\\nORLANDO\\r\\nWhat passion hangs these weights upon my tongue?\\r\\nI cannot speak to her, yet she urged conference.\\r\\nO poor Orlando, thou art overthrown!\\r\\nOr Charles or something weaker masters thee.\\r\\nRe-enter LE BEAU\\r\\n\\r\\nLE BEAU\\r\\nGood sir, I do in friendship counsel you\\r\\nTo leave this place. Albeit you have deserved\\r\\nHigh commendation, true applause and love,\\r\\nYet such is now the duke's condition\\r\\nThat he misconstrues all that you have done.\\r\\nThe duke is humorous; what he is indeed,\\r\\nMore suits you to conceive than I to speak of.\\r\\nORLANDO\\r\\nI thank you, sir: and, pray you, tell me this:\\r\\nWhich of the two was daughter of the duke\\r\\nThat here was at the wrestling?\\r\\nLE BEAU\\r\\nNeither his daughter, if we judge by manners;\\r\\nBut yet indeed the lesser is his daughter\\r\\nThe other is daughter to the banish'd duke,\\r\\nAnd here detain'd by her usurping uncle,\\r\\nTo keep his daughter company; whose loves\\r\\nAre dearer than the natural bond of sisters.\\r\\nBut I can tell you that of late this duke\\r\\nHath ta'en displeasure 'gainst his gentle niece,\\r\\nGrounded upon no other argument\\r\\nBut that the people praise her for her virtues\\r\\nAnd pity her for her good father's sake;\\r\\nAnd, on my life, his malice 'gainst the lady\\r\\nWill suddenly break forth. Sir, fare you well:\\r\\nHereafter, in a better world than this,\\r\\nI shall desire more love and knowledge of you.\\r\\nORLANDO\\r\\nI rest much bounden to you: fare you well.\\r\\nExit LE BEAU\\r\\n\\r\\nThus must I from the smoke into the smother;\\r\\nFrom tyrant duke unto a tyrant brother:\\r\\nBut heavenly Rosalind!\\r\\nExit\\r\\n\\r\\nSCENE III. A room in the palace.\\r\\nEnter CELIA and ROSALIND\\r\\nCELIA\\r\\nWhy, cousin! why, Rosalind! Cupid have mercy! not a word?\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nNot one to throw at a dog.\\r\\nCELIA\\r\\nNo, thy words are too precious to be cast away upon\\r\\ncurs; throw some of them at me; come, lame me with reasons.\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nThen there were two cousins laid up; when the one\\r\\nshould be lamed with reasons and the other mad\\r\\nwithout any.\\r\\nCELIA\\r\\nBut is all this for your father?\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nNo, some of it is for my child's father. O, how\\r\\nfull of briers is this working-day world!\\r\\nCELIA\\r\\nThey are but burs, cousin, thrown upon thee in\\r\\nholiday foolery: if we walk not in the trodden\\r\\npaths our very petticoats will catch them.\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nI could shake them off my coat: these burs are in my heart.\\r\\nCELIA\\r\\nHem them away.\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nI would try, if I could cry 'hem' and have him.\\r\\nCELIA\\r\\nCome, come, wrestle with thy affections.\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nO, they take the part of a better wrestler than myself!\\r\\nCELIA\\r\\nO, a good wish upon you! you will try in time, in\\r\\ndespite of a fall. But, turning these jests out of\\r\\nservice, let us talk in good earnest: is it\\r\\npossible, on such a sudden, you should fall into so\\r\\nstrong a liking with old Sir Rowland's youngest son?\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nThe duke my father loved his father dearly.\\r\\nCELIA\\r\\nDoth it therefore ensue that you should love his son\\r\\ndearly?

At first the infant,\\r\\nMewling and puking in the nurse's arms.\\r\\nAnd then the whining school-boy, with his satchel\\r\\nAnd shining morning face, creeping like snail\\r\\nUnwillingly to school. And then the lover,\\r\\nSighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad\\r\\nMade to his mistress' eyebrow. Then a soldier,\\r\\nFull of strange oaths and bearded like the pard,\\r\\nJealous in honour, sudden and quick in quarrel,\\r\\nSeeking the bubble reputation\\r\\nEven in the cannon's mouth. And then the justice,\\r\\nIn fair round belly with good capon lined,\\r\\nWith eyes severe and beard of formal cut,\\r\\nFull of wise saws and modern instances;\\r\\nAnd so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts\\r\\nInto the lean and slipper'd pantaloon,\\r\\nWith spectacles on nose and pouch on side,\\r\\nHis youthful hose, well saved, a world too wide\\r\\nFor his shrunk shank; and his big manly voice,\\r\\nTurning again toward childish treble, pipes\\r\\nAnd whistles in his sound. Last scene of all,\\r\\nThat ends this strange eventful history,\\r\\nIs second childishness and mere oblivion,\\r\\nSans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything.\\r\\nRe-enter ORLANDO, with ADAM\\r\\n\\r\\nDUKE SENIOR\\r\\nWelcome.

The forest.\\r\\nEnter ORLANDO, with a paper\\r\\nORLANDO\\r\\nHang there, my verse, in witness of my love:\\r\\nAnd thou, thrice-crowned queen of night, survey\\r\\nWith thy chaste eye, from thy pale sphere above,\\r\\nThy huntress' name that my full life doth sway.\\r\\nO Rosalind! these trees shall be my books\\r\\nAnd in their barks my thoughts I'll character;\\r\\nThat every eye which in this forest looks\\r\\nShall see thy virtue witness'd every where.\\r\\nRun, run, Orlando; carve on every tree\\r\\nThe fair, the chaste and unexpressive she.\\r\\nExit\\r\\n\\r\\nEnter CORIN and TOUCHSTONE\\r\\n\\r\\nCORIN\\r\\nAnd how like you this shepherd's life, Master Touchstone?\\r\\nTOUCHSTONE\\r\\nTruly, shepherd, in respect of itself, it is a good\\r\\nlife, but in respect that it is a shepherd's life,\\r\\nit is naught. In respect that it is solitary, I\\r\\nlike it very well; but in respect that it is\\r\\nprivate, it is a very vile life. Now, in respect it\\r\\nis in the fields, it pleaseth me well; but in\\r\\nrespect it is not in the court, it is tedious. As\\r\\nis it a spare life, look you, it fits my humour well;\\r\\nbut as there is no more plenty in it, it goes much\\r\\nagainst my stomach. Hast any philosophy in thee, shepherd?\\r\\nCORIN\\r\\nNo more but that I know the more one sickens the\\r\\nworse at ease he is; and that he that wants money,\\r\\nmeans and content is without three good friends;\\r\\nthat the property of rain is to wet and fire to\\r\\nburn; that good pasture makes fat sheep, and that a\\r\\ngreat cause of the night is lack of the sun; that\\r\\nhe that hath learned no wit by nature nor art may\\r\\ncomplain of good breeding or comes of a very dull kindred.\\r\\nTOUCHSTONE\\r\\nSuch a one is a natural philosopher. Wast ever in\\r\\ncourt, shepherd?\\r\\nCORIN\\r\\nNo, truly.\\r\\nTOUCHSTONE\\r\\nThen thou art damned.\\r\\nCORIN\\r\\nNay, I hope.\\r\\nTOUCHSTONE\\r\\nTruly, thou art damned like an ill-roasted egg, all\\r\\non one side.\\r\\nCORIN\\r\\nFor not being at court? Your reason.\\r\\nTOUCHSTONE\\r\\nWhy, if thou never wast at court, thou never sawest\\r\\ngood manners; if thou never sawest good manners,\\r\\nthen thy manners must be wicked; and wickedness is\\r\\nsin, and sin is damnation. Thou art in a parlous\\r\\nstate, shepherd.\\r\\nCORIN\\r\\nNot a whit, Touchstone: those that are good manners\\r\\nat the court are as ridiculous in the country as the\\r\\nbehavior of the country is most mockable at the\\r\\ncourt. You told me you salute not at the court, but\\r\\nyou kiss your hands: that courtesy would be\\r\\nuncleanly, if courtiers were shepherds.\\r\\nTOUCHSTONE\\r\\nInstance, briefly; come, instance.\\r\\nCORIN\\r\\nWhy, we are still handling our ewes, and their\\r\\nfells, you know, are greasy.\\r\\nTOUCHSTONE\\r\\nWhy, do not your courtier's hands sweat? and is not\\r\\nthe grease of a mutton as wholesome as the sweat of\\r\\na man? Shallow, shallow. A better instance, I say; come.\\r\\nCORIN\\r\\nBesides, our hands are hard.\\r\\nTOUCHSTONE\\r\\nYour lips will feel them the sooner. Shallow again.\\r\\nA more sounder instance, come.\\r\\nCORIN\\r\\nAnd they are often tarred over with the surgery of\\r\\nour sheep: and would you have us kiss tar? The\\r\\ncourtier's hands are perfumed with civet.\\r\\nTOUCHSTONE\\r\\nMost shallow man! thou worms-meat, in respect of a\\r\\ngood piece of flesh indeed! Learn of the wise, and\\r\\nperpend: civet is of a baser birth than tar, the\\r\\nvery uncleanly flux of a cat. Mend the instance, shepherd.\\r\\nCORIN\\r\\nYou have too courtly a wit for me: I'll rest.\\r\\nTOUCHSTONE\\r\\nWilt thou rest damned? God help thee, shallow man!\\r\\nGod make incision in thee! thou art raw.\\r\\nCORIN\\r\\nSir, I am a true labourer: I earn that I eat, get\\r\\nthat I wear, owe no man hate, envy no man's\\r\\nhappiness, glad of other men's good, content with my\\r\\nharm, and the greatest of my pride is to see my ewes\\r\\ngraze and my lambs suck.\\r\\nTOUCHSTONE\\r\\nThat is another simple sin in you, to bring the ewes\\r\\nand the rams together and to offer to get your\\r\\nliving by the copulation of cattle; to be bawd to a\\r\\nbell-wether, and to betray a she-lamb of a\\r\\ntwelvemonth to a crooked-pated, old, cuckoldly ram,\\r\\nout of all reasonable match. If thou beest not\\r\\ndamned for this, the devil himself will have no\\r\\nshepherds; I cannot see else how thou shouldst\\r\\n'scape.\\r\\nCORIN\\r\\nHere comes young Master Ganymede, my new mistress's brother.\\r\\nEnter ROSALIND, with a paper, reading\\r\\n\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nFrom the east to western Ind,\\r\\nNo jewel is like Rosalind.\\r\\nHer worth, being mounted on the wind,\\r\\nThrough all the world bears Rosalind.\\r\\nAll the pictures fairest lined\\r\\nAre but black to Rosalind.\\r\\nLet no fair be kept in mind\\r\\nBut the fair of Rosalind.\\r\\nTOUCHSTONE\\r\\nI'll rhyme you so eight years together, dinners and\\r\\nsuppers and sleeping-hours excepted: it is the\\r\\nright butter-women's rank to market.\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nOut, fool!\\r\\nTOUCHSTONE\\r\\nFor a taste:\\r\\nIf a hart do lack a hind,\\r\\nLet him seek out Rosalind.\\r\\nIf the cat will after kind,\\r\\nSo be sure will Rosalind.\\r\\nWinter garments must be lined,\\r\\nSo must slender Rosalind.\\r\\nThey that reap must sheaf and bind;\\r\\nThen to cart with Rosalind.\\r\\nSweetest nut hath sourest rind,\\r\\nSuch a nut is Rosalind.\\r\\nHe that sweetest rose will find\\r\\nMust find love's prick and Rosalind.\\r\\nThis is the very false gallop of verses: why do you\\r\\ninfect yourself with them?\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nPeace, you dull fool! I found them on a tree.\\r\\nTOUCHSTONE\\r\\nTruly, the tree yields bad fruit.\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nI'll graff it with you, and then I shall graff it\\r\\nwith a medlar: then it will be the earliest fruit\\r\\ni' the country; for you'll be rotten ere you be half\\r\\nripe, and that's the right virtue of the medlar.\\r\\nTOUCHSTONE\\r\\nYou have said; but whether wisely or no, let the\\r\\nforest judge.\\r\\nEnter CELIA, with a writing\\r\\n\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nPeace! Here comes my sister, reading: stand aside.\\r\\nCELIA\\r\\n[Reads]\\r\\nWhy should this a desert be?\\r\\nFor it is unpeopled? No:\\r\\nTongues I'll hang on every tree,\\r\\nThat shall civil sayings show:\\r\\nSome, how brief the life of man\\r\\nRuns his erring pilgrimage,\\r\\nThat the stretching of a span\\r\\nBuckles in his sum of age;\\r\\nSome, of violated vows\\r\\n'Twixt the souls of friend and friend:\\r\\nBut upon the fairest boughs,\\r\\nOr at every sentence end,\\r\\nWill I Rosalinda write,\\r\\nTeaching all that read to know\\r\\nThe quintessence of every sprite\\r\\nHeaven would in little show.\\r\\nTherefore Heaven Nature charged\\r\\nThat one body should be fill'd\\r\\nWith all graces wide-enlarged:\\r\\nNature presently distill'd\\r\\nHelen's cheek, but not her heart,\\r\\nCleopatra's majesty,\\r\\nAtalanta's better part,\\r\\nSad Lucretia's modesty.\\r\\nThus Rosalind of many parts\\r\\nBy heavenly synod was devised,\\r\\nOf many faces, eyes and hearts,\\r\\nTo have the touches dearest prized.\\r\\nHeaven would that she these gifts should have,\\r\\nAnd I to live and die her slave.\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nO most gentle pulpiter! what tedious homily of love\\r\\nhave you wearied your parishioners withal, and never\\r\\ncried 'Have patience, good people!'\\r\\nCELIA\\r\\nHow now! back, friends! Shepherd, go off a little.\\r\\nGo with him, sirrah.\\r\\nTOUCHSTONE\\r\\nCome, shepherd, let us make an honourable retreat;\\r\\nthough not with bag and baggage, yet with scrip and scrippage.\\r\\nExeunt CORIN and TOUCHSTONE\\r\\n\\r\\nCELIA\\r\\nDidst thou hear these verses?\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nO, yes, I heard them all, and more too; for some of\\r\\nthem had in them more feet than the verses would bear.\\r\\nCELIA\\r\\nThat's no matter: the feet might bear the verses.\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nAy, but the feet were lame and could not bear\\r\\nthemselves without the verse and therefore stood\\r\\nlamely in the verse.\\r\\nCELIA\\r\\nBut didst thou hear without wondering how thy name\\r\\nshould be hanged and carved upon these trees?\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nI was seven of the nine days out of the wonder\\r\\nbefore you came; for look here what I found on a\\r\\npalm-tree. I was never so be-rhymed since\\r\\nPythagoras' time, that I was an Irish rat, which I\\r\\ncan hardly remember.\\r\\nCELIA\\r\\nTrow you who hath done this?\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nIs it a man?\\r\\nCELIA\\r\\nAnd a chain, that you once wore, about his neck.\\r\\nChange you colour?\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nI prithee, who?\\r\\nCELIA\\r\\nO Lord, Lord! it is a hard matter for friends to\\r\\nmeet; but mountains may be removed with earthquakes\\r\\nand so encounter.\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nNay, but who is it?\\r\\nCELIA\\r\\nIs it possible?\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nNay, I prithee now with most petitionary vehemence,\\r\\ntell me who it is.\\r\\nCELIA\\r\\nO wonderful, wonderful, and most wonderful\\r\\nwonderful! and yet again wonderful, and after that,\\r\\nout of all hooping!\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nGood my complexion! dost thou think, though I am\\r\\ncaparisoned like a man, I have a doublet and hose in\\r\\nmy disposition? One inch of delay more is a\\r\\nSouth-sea of discovery; I prithee, tell me who is it\\r\\nquickly, and speak apace. I would thou couldst\\r\\nstammer, that thou mightst pour this concealed man\\r\\nout of thy mouth, as wine comes out of a narrow-\\r\\nmouthed bottle, either too much at once, or none at\\r\\nall. I prithee, take the cork out of thy mouth that\\r\\nmay drink thy tidings.\\r\\nCELIA\\r\\nSo you may put a man in your belly.\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nIs he of God's making? What manner of man? Is his\\r\\nhead worth a hat, or his chin worth a beard?\\r\\nCELIA\\r\\nNay, he hath but a little beard.\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nWhy, God will send more, if the man will be\\r\\nthankful: let me stay the growth of his beard, if\\r\\nthou delay me not the knowledge of his chin.\\r\\nCELIA\\r\\nIt is young Orlando, that tripped up the wrestler's\\r\\nheels and your heart both in an instant.\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nNay, but the devil take mocking: speak, sad brow and\\r\\ntrue maid.\\r\\nCELIA\\r\\nI' faith, coz, 'tis he.\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nOrlando?\\r\\nCELIA\\r\\nOrlando.\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nAlas the day! what shall I do with my doublet and\\r\\nhose? What did he when thou sawest him? What said\\r\\nhe? How looked he? Wherein went he? What makes\\r\\nhim here? Did he ask for me? Where remains he?\\r\\nHow parted he with thee? and when shalt thou see\\r\\nhim again? Answer me in one word.\\r\\nCELIA\\r\\nYou must borrow me Gargantua's mouth first: 'tis a\\r\\nword too great for any mouth of this age's size. To\\r\\nsay ay and no to these particulars is more than to\\r\\nanswer in a catechism.\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nBut doth he know that I am in this forest and in\\r\\nman's apparel? Looks he as freshly as he did the\\r\\nday he wrestled?\\r\\nCELIA\\r\\nIt is as easy to count atomies as to resolve the\\r\\npropositions of a lover; but take a taste of my\\r\\nfinding him, and relish it with good observance.\\r\\nI found him under a tree, like a dropped acorn.\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nIt may well be called Jove's tree, when it drops\\r\\nforth such fruit.\\r\\nCELIA\\r\\nGive me audience, good madam.\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nProceed.\\r\\nCELIA\\r\\nThere lay he, stretched along, like a wounded knight.\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nThough it be pity to see such a sight, it well\\r\\nbecomes the ground.\\r\\nCELIA\\r\\nCry 'holla' to thy tongue, I prithee; it curvets\\r\\nunseasonably. He was furnished like a hunter.\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nO, ominous! he comes to kill my heart.\\r\\nCELIA\\r\\nI would sing my song without a burden: thou bringest\\r\\nme out of tune.\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nDo you not know I am a woman? when I think, I must\\r\\nspeak. Sweet, say on.\\r\\nCELIA\\r\\nYou bring me out. Soft! comes he not here?\\r\\nEnter ORLANDO and JAQUES\\r\\n\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\n'Tis he: slink by, and note him.\\r\\nJAQUES\\r\\nI thank you for your company; but, good faith, I had\\r\\nas lief have been myself alone.\\r\\nORLANDO\\r\\nAnd so had I; but yet, for fashion sake, I thank you\\r\\ntoo for your society.\\r\\nJAQUES\\r\\nGod be wi' you: let's meet as little as we can.\\r\\nORLANDO\\r\\nI do desire we may be better strangers.\\r\\nJAQUES\\r\\nI pray you, mar no more trees with writing\\r\\nlove-songs in their barks.\\r\\nORLANDO\\r\\nI pray you, mar no more of my verses with reading\\r\\nthem ill-favouredly.\\r\\nJAQUES\\r\\nRosalind is your love's name?\\r\\nORLANDO\\r\\nYes, just.\\r\\nJAQUES\\r\\nI do not like her name.\\r\\nORLANDO\\r\\nThere was no thought of pleasing you when she was\\r\\nchristened.\\r\\nJAQUES\\r\\nWhat stature is she of?\\r\\nORLANDO\\r\\nJust as high as my heart.\\r\\nJAQUES\\r\\nYou are full of pretty answers.

I have heard\\r\\nhim read many lectures against it, and I thank God\\r\\nI am not a woman, to be touched with so many\\r\\ngiddy offences as he hath generally taxed their\\r\\nwhole sex withal.\\r\\nORLANDO\\r\\nCan you remember any of the principal evils that he\\r\\nlaid to the charge of women?\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nThere were none principal; they were all like one\\r\\nanother as half-pence are, every one fault seeming\\r\\nmonstrous till his fellow fault came to match it.\\r\\nORLANDO\\r\\nI prithee, recount some of them.\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nNo, I will not cast away my physic but on those that\\r\\nare sick. There is a man haunts the forest, that\\r\\nabuses our young plants with carving 'Rosalind' on\\r\\ntheir barks; hangs odes upon hawthorns and elegies\\r\\non brambles, all, forsooth, deifying the name of\\r\\nRosalind: if I could meet that fancy-monger I would\\r\\ngive him some good counsel, for he seems to have the\\r\\nquotidian of love upon him.\\r\\nORLANDO\\r\\nI am he that is so love-shaked: I pray you tell me\\r\\nyour remedy.\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nThere is none of my uncle's marks upon you: he\\r\\ntaught me how to know a man in love; in which cage\\r\\nof rushes I am sure you are not prisoner.\\r\\nORLANDO\\r\\nWhat were his marks?\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nA lean cheek, which you have not, a blue eye and\\r\\nsunken, which you have not, an unquestionable\\r\\nspirit, which you have not, a beard neglected,\\r\\nwhich you have not; but I pardon you for that, for\\r\\nsimply your having in beard is a younger brother's\\r\\nrevenue: then your hose should be ungartered, your\\r\\nbonnet unbanded, your sleeve unbuttoned, your shoe\\r\\nuntied and every thing about you demonstrating a\\r\\ncareless desolation; but you are no such man; you\\r\\nare rather point-device in your accoutrements as\\r\\nloving yourself than seeming the lover of any other.\\r\\nORLANDO\\r\\nFair youth, I would I could make thee believe I love.\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nMe believe it! you may as soon make her that you\\r\\nlove believe it; which, I warrant, she is apter to\\r\\ndo than to confess she does: that is one of the\\r\\npoints in the which women still give the lie to\\r\\ntheir consciences. But, in good sooth, are you he\\r\\nthat hangs the verses on the trees, wherein Rosalind\\r\\nis so admired?\\r\\nORLANDO\\r\\nI swear to thee, youth, by the white hand of\\r\\nRosalind, I am that he, that unfortunate he.\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nBut are you so much in love as your rhymes speak?\\r\\nORLANDO\\r\\nNeither rhyme nor reason can express how much.\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nLove is merely a madness, and, I tell you, deserves\\r\\nas well a dark house and a whip as madmen do: and\\r\\nthe reason why they are not so punished and cured\\r\\nis, that the lunacy is so ordinary that the whippers\\r\\nare in love too. Yet I profess curing it by counsel.\\r\\nORLANDO\\r\\nDid you ever cure any so?\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nYes, one, and in this manner. He was to imagine me\\r\\nhis love, his mistress; and I set him every day to\\r\\nwoo me: at which time would I, being but a moonish\\r\\nyouth, grieve, be effeminate, changeable, longing\\r\\nand liking, proud, fantastical, apish, shallow,\\r\\ninconstant, full of tears, full of smiles, for every\\r\\npassion something and for no passion truly any\\r\\nthing, as boys and women are for the most part\\r\\ncattle of this colour; would now like him, now loathe\\r\\nhim; then entertain him, then forswear him; now weep\\r\\nfor him, then spit at him; that I drave my suitor\\r\\nfrom his mad humour of love to a living humour of\\r\\nmadness; which was, to forswear the full stream of\\r\\nthe world, and to live in a nook merely monastic.\\r\\nAnd thus I cured him; and this way will I take upon\\r\\nme to wash your liver as clean as a sound sheep's\\r\\nheart, that there shall not be one spot of love in't.\\r\\nORLANDO\\r\\nI would not be cured, youth.\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nI would cure you, if you would but call me Rosalind\\r\\nand come every day to my cote and woo me.\\r\\nORLANDO\\r\\nNow, by the faith of my love, I will: tell me\\r\\nwhere it is.\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nGo with me to it and I'll show it you and by the way\\r\\nyou shall tell me where in the forest you live.\\r\\nWill you go?\\r\\nORLANDO\\r\\nWith all my heart, good youth.\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nNay you must call me Rosalind. Come, sister, will you go?\\r\\nExeunt\\r\\n\\r\\nSCENE III. The forest.\\r\\nEnter TOUCHSTONE and AUDREY; JAQUES behind\\r\\nTOUCHSTONE\\r\\nCome apace, good Audrey: I will fetch up your\\r\\ngoats, Audrey. And how, Audrey? am I the man yet?\\r\\ndoth my simple feature content you?\\r\\nAUDREY\\r\\nYour features! Lord warrant us! what features!\\r\\nTOUCHSTONE\\r\\nI am here with thee and thy goats, as the most\\r\\ncapricious poet, honest Ovid, was among the Goths.\\r\\nJAQUES\\r\\n[Aside] O knowledge ill-inhabited, worse than Jove\\r\\nin a thatched house!\\r\\nTOUCHSTONE\\r\\nWhen a man's verses cannot be understood, nor a\\r\\nman's good wit seconded with the forward child\\r\\nUnderstanding, it strikes a man more dead than a\\r\\ngreat reckoning in a little room. Truly, I would\\r\\nthe gods had made thee poetical.\\r\\nAUDREY\\r\\nI do not know what 'poetical' is: is it honest in\\r\\ndeed and word? is it a true thing?\\r\\nTOUCHSTONE\\r\\nNo, truly; for the truest poetry is the most\\r\\nfeigning; and lovers are given to poetry, and what\\r\\nthey swear in poetry may be said as lovers they do feign.\\r\\nAUDREY\\r\\nDo you wish then that the gods had made me poetical?\\r\\nTOUCHSTONE\\r\\nI do, truly; for thou swearest to me thou art\\r\\nhonest: now, if thou wert a poet, I might have some\\r\\nhope thou didst feign.\\r\\nAUDREY\\r\\nWould you not have me honest?\\r\\nTOUCHSTONE\\r\\nNo, truly, unless thou wert hard-favoured; for\\r\\nhonesty coupled to beauty is to have honey a sauce to sugar.\\r\\nJAQUES\\r\\n[Aside] A material fool!\\r\\nAUDREY\\r\\nWell, I am not fair; and therefore I pray the gods\\r\\nmake me honest.\\r\\nTOUCHSTONE\\r\\nTruly, and to cast away honesty upon a foul slut\\r\\nwere to put good meat into an unclean dish.\\r\\nAUDREY\\r\\nI am not a slut, though I thank the gods I am foul.\\r\\nTOUCHSTONE\\r\\nWell, praised be the gods for thy foulness!\\r\\nsluttishness may come hereafter. But be it as it may\\r\\nbe, I will marry thee, and to that end I have been\\r\\nwith Sir Oliver Martext, the vicar of the next\\r\\nvillage, who hath promised to meet me in this place\\r\\nof the forest and to couple us.\\r\\nJAQUES\\r\\n[Aside] I would fain see this meeting.\\r\\nAUDREY\\r\\nWell, the gods give us joy!\\r\\nTOUCHSTONE\\r\\nAmen. A man may, if he were of a fearful heart,\\r\\nstagger in this attempt; for here we have no temple\\r\\nbut the wood, no assembly but horn-beasts. But what\\r\\nthough? C ourage! As horns are odious, they are\\r\\nnecessary. It is said, 'many a man knows no end of\\r\\nhis goods:' right; many a man has good horns, and\\r\\nknows no end of them. Well, that is the dowry of\\r\\nhis wife; 'tis none of his own getting. Horns?\\r\\nEven so. Poor men alone? No, no; the noblest deer\\r\\nhath them as huge as the rascal. Is the single man\\r\\ntherefore blessed? No: as a walled town is more\\r\\nworthier than a village, so is the forehead of a\\r\\nmarried man more honourable than the bare brow of a\\r\\nbachelor; and by how much defence is better than no\\r\\nskill, by so much is a horn more precious than to\\r\\nwant. Here comes Sir Oliver.\\r\\nEnter SIR OLIVER MARTEXT\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Oliver Martext, you are well met: will you\\r\\ndispatch us here under this tree, or shall we go\\r\\nwith you to your chapel?\\r\\nSIR OLIVER MARTEXT\\r\\nIs there none here to give the woman?\\r\\nTOUCHSTONE\\r\\nI will not take her on gift of any man.\\r\\nSIR OLIVER MARTEXT\\r\\nTruly, she must be given, or the marriage is not lawful.\\r\\nJAQUES\\r\\n[Advancing]\\r\\nProceed, proceed I'll give her.\\r\\nTOUCHSTONE\\r\\nGood even, good Master What-ye-call't: how do you,\\r\\nsir? You are very well met: God 'ild you for your\\r\\nlast company: I am very glad to see you: even a\\r\\ntoy in hand here, sir: nay, pray be covered.\\r\\nJAQUES\\r\\nWill you be married, motley?\\r\\nTOUCHSTONE\\r\\nAs the ox hath his bow, sir, the horse his curb and\\r\\nthe falcon her bells, so man hath his desires; and\\r\\nas pigeons bill, so wedlock would be nibbling.\\r\\nJAQUES\\r\\nAnd will you, being a man of your breeding, be\\r\\nmarried under a bush like a beggar? Get you to\\r\\nchurch, and have a good priest that can tell you\\r\\nwhat marriage is: this fellow will but join you\\r\\ntogether as they join wainscot; then one of you will\\r\\nprove a shrunk panel and, like green timber, warp, warp.\\r\\nTOUCHSTONE\\r\\n[Aside] I am not in the mind but I were better to be\\r\\nmarried of him than of another: for he is not like\\r\\nto marry me well; and not being well married, it\\r\\nwill be a good excuse for me hereafter to leave my wife.\\r\\nJAQUES\\r\\nGo thou with me, and let me counsel thee.\\r\\nTOUCHSTONE\\r\\n'Come, sweet Audrey:\\r\\nWe must be married, or we must live in bawdry.\\r\\nFarewell, good Master Oliver: not,--\\r\\nO sweet Oliver,\\r\\nO brave Oliver,\\r\\nLeave me not behind thee: but,--\\r\\nWind away,\\r\\nBegone, I say,\\r\\nI will not to wedding with thee.\\r\\nExeunt JAQUES, TOUCHSTONE and AUDREY\\r\\n\\r\\nSIR OLIVER MARTEXT\\r\\n'Tis no matter: ne'er a fantastical knave of them\\r\\nall shall flout me out of my calling.\\r\\nExit\\r\\n\\r\\nSCENE IV.

He attends\\r\\nhere in the forest on the duke your father.\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nI met the duke yesterday and had much question with\\r\\nhim: he asked me of what parentage I was; I told\\r\\nhim, of as good as he; so he laughed and let me go.\\r\\nBut what talk we of fathers, when there is such a\\r\\nman as Orlando?\\r\\nCELIA\\r\\nO, that's a brave man! he writes brave verses,\\r\\nspeaks brave words, swears brave oaths and breaks\\r\\nthem bravely, quite traverse, athwart the heart of\\r\\nhis lover; as a puisny tilter, that spurs his horse\\r\\nbut on one side, breaks his staff like a noble\\r\\ngoose: but all's brave that youth mounts and folly\\r\\nguides. Who comes here?\\r\\nEnter CORIN\\r\\n\\r\\nCORIN\\r\\nMistress and master, you have oft inquired\\r\\nAfter the shepherd that complain'd of love,\\r\\nWho you saw sitting by me on the turf,\\r\\nPraising the proud disdainful shepherdess\\r\\nThat was his mistress.\\r\\nCELIA\\r\\nWell, and what of him?\\r\\nCORIN\\r\\nIf you will see a pageant truly play'd,\\r\\nBetween the pale complexion of true love\\r\\nAnd the red glow of scorn and proud disdain,\\r\\nGo hence a little and I shall conduct you,\\r\\nIf you will mark it.\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nO, come, let us remove:\\r\\nThe sight of lovers feedeth those in love.\\r\\nBring us to this sight, and you shall say\\r\\nI'll prove a busy actor in their play.\\r\\nExeunt\\r\\n\\r\\nSCENE V.

What though you have no beauty,--\\r\\nAs, by my faith, I see no more in you\\r\\nThan without candle may go dark to bed--\\r\\nMust you be therefore proud and pitiless?\\r\\nWhy, what means this? Why do you look on me?\\r\\nI see no more in you than in the ordinary\\r\\nOf nature's sale-work. 'Od's my little life,\\r\\nI think she means to tangle my eyes too!\\r\\nNo, faith, proud mistress, hope not after it:\\r\\n'Tis not your inky brows, your black silk hair,\\r\\nYour bugle eyeballs, nor your cheek of cream,\\r\\nThat can entame my spirits to your worship.\\r\\nYou foolish shepherd, wherefore do you follow her,\\r\\nLike foggy south puffing with wind and rain?\\r\\nYou are a thousand times a properer man\\r\\nThan she a woman: 'tis such fools as you\\r\\nThat makes the world full of ill-favour'd children:\\r\\n'Tis not her glass, but you, that flatters her;\\r\\nAnd out of you she sees herself more proper\\r\\nThan any of her lineaments can show her.\\r\\nBut, mistress, know yourself: down on your knees,\\r\\nAnd thank heaven, fasting, for a good man's love:\\r\\nFor I must tell you friendly in your ear,\\r\\nSell when you can: you are not for all markets:\\r\\nCry the man mercy; love him; take his offer:\\r\\nFoul is most foul, being foul to be a scoffer.\\r\\nSo take her to thee, shepherd: fare you well.\\r\\nPHEBE\\r\\nSweet youth, I pray you, chide a year together:\\r\\nI had rather hear you chide than this man woo.\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nHe's fallen in love with your foulness and she'll\\r\\nfall in love with my anger.

Very good orators, when they are\\r\\nout, they will spit; and for lovers lacking--God\\r\\nwarn us!--matter, the cleanliest shift is to kiss.\\r\\nORLANDO\\r\\nHow if the kiss be denied?\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nThen she puts you to entreaty, and there begins new matter.\\r\\nORLANDO\\r\\nWho could be out, being before his beloved mistress?\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nMarry, that should you, if I were your mistress, or\\r\\nI should think my honesty ranker than my wit.\\r\\nORLANDO\\r\\nWhat, of my suit?\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nNot out of your apparel, and yet out of your suit.\\r\\nAm not I your Rosalind?\\r\\nORLANDO\\r\\nI take some joy to say you are, because I would be\\r\\ntalking of her.\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nWell in her person I say I will not have you.\\r\\nORLANDO\\r\\nThen in mine own person I die.\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nNo, faith, die by attorney. The poor world is\\r\\nalmost six thousand years old, and in all this time\\r\\nthere was not any man died in his own person,\\r\\nvidelicit, in a love-cause. Troilus had his brains\\r\\ndashed out with a Grecian club; yet he did what he\\r\\ncould to die before, and he is one of the patterns\\r\\nof love. Leander, he would have lived many a fair\\r\\nyear, though Hero had turned nun, if it had not been\\r\\nfor a hot midsummer night; for, good youth, he went\\r\\nbut forth to wash him in the Hellespont and being\\r\\ntaken with the cramp was drowned and the foolish\\r\\ncoroners of that age found it was 'Hero of Sestos.'\\r\\nBut these are all lies: men have died from time to\\r\\ntime and worms have eaten them, but not for love.\\r\\nORLANDO\\r\\nI would not have my right Rosalind of this mind,\\r\\nfor, I protest, her frown might kill me.\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nBy this hand, it will not kill a fly. But come, now\\r\\nI will be your Rosalind in a more coming-on\\r\\ndisposition, and ask me what you will. I will grant\\r\\nit.\\r\\nORLANDO\\r\\nThen love me, Rosalind.\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nYes, faith, will I, Fridays and Saturdays and all.\\r\\nORLANDO\\r\\nAnd wilt thou have me?\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nAy, and twenty such.\\r\\nORLANDO\\r\\nWhat sayest thou?\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nAre you not good?\\r\\nORLANDO\\r\\nI hope so.\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nWhy then, can one desire too much of a good thing?\\r\\nCome, sister, you shall be the priest and marry us.\\r\\nGive me your hand, Orlando. What do you say, sister?\\r\\nORLANDO\\r\\nPray thee, marry us.\\r\\nCELIA\\r\\nI cannot say the words.\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nYou must begin, 'Will you, Orlando--'\\r\\nCELIA\\r\\nGo to. Will you, Orlando, have to wife this Rosalind?\\r\\nORLANDO\\r\\nI will.\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nAy, but when?\\r\\nORLANDO\\r\\nWhy now; as fast as she can marry us.\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nThen you must say 'I take thee, Rosalind, for wife.'\\r\\nORLANDO\\r\\nI take thee, Rosalind, for wife.\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nI might ask you for your commission; but I do take\\r\\nthee, Orlando, for my husband: there's a girl goes\\r\\nbefore the priest; and certainly a woman's thought\\r\\nruns before her actions.\\r\\nORLANDO\\r\\nSo do all thoughts; they are winged.\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nNow tell me how long you would have her after you\\r\\nhave possessed her.\\r\\nORLANDO\\r\\nFor ever and a day.\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nSay 'a day,' without the 'ever.' No, no, Orlando;\\r\\nmen are April when they woo, December when they wed:\\r\\nmaids are May when they are maids, but the sky\\r\\nchanges when they are wives. I will be more jealous\\r\\nof thee than a Barbary cock-pigeon over his hen,\\r\\nmore clamorous than a parrot against rain, more\\r\\nnew-fangled than an ape, more giddy in my desires\\r\\nthan a monkey: I will weep for nothing, like Diana\\r\\nin the fountain, and I will do that when you are\\r\\ndisposed to be merry; I will laugh like a hyen, and\\r\\nthat when thou art inclined to sleep.\\r\\nORLANDO\\r\\nBut will my Rosalind do so?\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nBy my life, she will do as I do.\\r\\nORLANDO\\r\\nO, but she is wise.\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nOr else she could not have the wit to do this: the\\r\\nwiser, the waywarder: make the doors upon a woman's\\r\\nwit and it will out at the casement; shut that and\\r\\n'twill out at the key-hole; stop that, 'twill fly\\r\\nwith the smoke out at the chimney.\\r\\nORLANDO\\r\\nA man that had a wife with such a wit, he might say\\r\\n'Wit, whither wilt?'\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nNay, you might keep that cheque for it till you met\\r\\nyour wife's wit going to your neighbour's bed.\\r\\nORLANDO\\r\\nAnd what wit could wit have to excuse that?\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nMarry, to say she came to seek you there. You shall\\r\\nnever take her without her answer, unless you take\\r\\nher without her tongue. O, that woman that cannot\\r\\nmake her fault her husband's occasion, let her\\r\\nnever nurse her child herself, for she will breed\\r\\nit like a fool!\\r\\nORLANDO\\r\\nFor these two hours, Rosalind, I will leave thee.\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nAlas! dear love, I cannot lack thee two hours.\\r\\nORLANDO\\r\\nI must attend the duke at dinner: by two o'clock I\\r\\nwill be with thee again.\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nAy, go your ways, go your ways; I knew what you\\r\\nwould prove: my friends told me as much, and I\\r\\nthought no less: that flattering tongue of yours\\r\\nwon me: 'tis but one cast away, and so, come,\\r\\ndeath! Two o'clock is your hour?\\r\\nORLANDO\\r\\nAy, sweet Rosalind.\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nBy my troth, and in good earnest, and so God mend\\r\\nme, and by all pretty oaths that are not dangerous,\\r\\nif you break one jot of your promise or come one\\r\\nminute behind your hour, I will think you the most\\r\\npathetical break-promise and the most hollow lover\\r\\nand the most unworthy of her you call Rosalind that\\r\\nmay be chosen out of the gross band of the\\r\\nunfaithful: therefore beware my censure and keep\\r\\nyour promise.\\r\\nORLANDO\\r\\nWith no less religion than if thou wert indeed my\\r\\nRosalind: so adieu.\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nWell, Time is the old justice that examines all such\\r\\noffenders, and let Time try: adieu.\\r\\nExit ORLANDO\\r\\n\\r\\nCELIA\\r\\nYou have simply misused our sex in your love-prate:\\r\\nwe must have your doublet and hose plucked over your\\r\\nhead, and show the world what the bird hath done to\\r\\nher own nest.\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nO coz, coz, coz, my pretty little coz, that thou\\r\\ndidst know how many fathom deep I am in love! But\\r\\nit cannot be sounded: my affection hath an unknown\\r\\nbottom, like the bay of Portugal.\\r\\nCELIA\\r\\nOr rather, bottomless, that as fast as you pour\\r\\naffection in, it runs out.\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nNo, that same wicked bastard of Venus that was begot\\r\\nof thought, conceived of spleen and born of madness,\\r\\nthat blind rascally boy that abuses every one's eyes\\r\\nbecause his own are out, let him be judge how deep I\\r\\nam in love. I'll tell thee, Aliena, I cannot be out\\r\\nof the sight of Orlando: I'll go find a shadow and\\r\\nsigh till he come.\\r\\nCELIA\\r\\nAnd I'll sleep.\\r\\nExeunt\\r\\n\\r\\nSCENE II.

'Od's my will!\\r\\nHer love is not the hare that I do hunt:\\r\\nWhy writes she so to me? Well, shepherd, well,\\r\\nThis is a letter of your own device.\\r\\nSILVIUS\\r\\nNo, I protest, I know not the contents:\\r\\nPhebe did write it.\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nCome, come, you are a fool\\r\\nAnd turn'd into the extremity of love.\\r\\nI saw her hand: she has a leathern hand.\\r\\nA freestone-colour'd hand; I verily did think\\r\\nThat her old gloves were on, but 'twas her hands:\\r\\nShe has a huswife's hand; but that's no matter:\\r\\nI say she never did invent this letter;\\r\\nThis is a man's invention and his hand.\\r\\nSILVIUS\\r\\nSure, it is hers.\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nWhy, 'tis a boisterous and a cruel style.\\r\\nA style for-challengers; why, she defies me,\\r\\nLike Turk to Christian: women's gentle brain\\r\\nCould not drop forth such giant-rude invention\\r\\nSuch Ethiope words, blacker in their effect\\r\\nThan in their countenance. Will you hear the letter?\\r\\nSILVIUS\\r\\nSo please you, for I never heard it yet;\\r\\nYet heard too much of Phebe's cruelty.\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nShe Phebes me: mark how the tyrant writes.\\r\\nReads\\r\\n\\r\\nArt thou god to shepherd turn'd,\\r\\nThat a maiden's heart hath burn'd?\\r\\nCan a woman rail thus?\\r\\nSILVIUS\\r\\nCall you this railing?\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\n[Reads]\\r\\nWhy, thy godhead laid apart,\\r\\nWarr'st thou with a woman's heart?\\r\\nDid you ever hear such railing?\\r\\nWhiles the eye of man did woo me,\\r\\nThat could do no vengeance to me.\\r\\nMeaning me a beast.\\r\\nIf the scorn of your bright eyne\\r\\nHave power to raise such love in mine,\\r\\nAlack, in me what strange effect\\r\\nWould they work in mild aspect!\\r\\nWhiles you chid me, I did love;\\r\\nHow then might your prayers move!\\r\\nHe that brings this love to thee\\r\\nLittle knows this love in me:\\r\\nAnd by him seal up thy mind;\\r\\nWhether that thy youth and kind\\r\\nWill the faithful offer take\\r\\nOf me and all that I can make;\\r\\nOr else by him my love deny,\\r\\nAnd then I'll study how to die.\\r\\nSILVIUS\\r\\nCall you this chiding?\\r\\nCELIA\\r\\nAlas, poor shepherd!\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nDo you pity him? no, he deserves no pity.

Ah, sirrah, a body would\\r\\nthink this was well counterfeited! I pray you, tell\\r\\nyour brother how well I counterfeited.

I did dislike the\\r\\ncut of a certain courtier's beard: he sent me word,\\r\\nif I said his beard was not cut well, he was in the\\r\\nmind it was: this is called the Retort Courteous.\\r\\nIf I sent him word again 'it was not well cut,' he\\r\\nwould send me word, he cut it to please himself:\\r\\nthis is called the Quip Modest. If again 'it was\\r\\nnot well cut,' he disabled my judgment: this is\\r\\ncalled the Reply Churlish.

This entertainment\\r\\nMay a free face put on, derive a liberty\\r\\nFrom heartiness, from bounty, fertile bosom,\\r\\nAnd well become the agent; 't may, I grant;\\r\\nBut to be paddling palms and pinching fingers,\\r\\nAs now they are, and making practised smiles,\\r\\nAs in a looking-glass, and then to sigh, as 'twere\\r\\nThe mort o' the deer; O, that is entertainment\\r\\nMy bosom likes not, nor my brows! Mamillius,\\r\\nArt thou my boy?\\r\\nMAMILLIUS\\r\\nAy, my good lord.\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nI' fecks!\\r\\nWhy, that's my bawcock. What, hast\\r\\nsmutch'd thy nose?\\r\\nThey say it is a copy out of mine. Come, captain,\\r\\nWe must be neat; not neat, but cleanly, captain:\\r\\nAnd yet the steer, the heifer and the calf\\r\\nAre all call'd neat.--Still virginalling\\r\\nUpon his palm!--How now, you wanton calf!\\r\\nArt thou my calf?\\r\\nMAMILLIUS\\r\\nYes, if you will, my lord.\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nThou want'st a rough pash and the shoots that I have,\\r\\nTo be full like me: yet they say we are\\r\\nAlmost as like as eggs; women say so,\\r\\nThat will say anything but were they false\\r\\nAs o'er-dyed blacks, as wind, as waters, false\\r\\nAs dice are to be wish'd by one that fixes\\r\\nNo bourn 'twixt his and mine, yet were it true\\r\\nTo say this boy were like me. Come, sir page,\\r\\nLook on me with your welkin eye: sweet villain!\\r\\nMost dear'st! my collop! Can thy dam?--may't be?--\\r\\nAffection! thy intention stabs the centre:\\r\\nThou dost make possible things not so held,\\r\\nCommunicatest with dreams;--how can this be?--\\r\\nWith what's unreal thou coactive art,\\r\\nAnd fellow'st nothing: then 'tis very credent\\r\\nThou mayst co-join with something; and thou dost,\\r\\nAnd that beyond commission, and I find it,\\r\\nAnd that to the infection of my brains\\r\\nAnd hardening of my brows.\\r\\nPOLIXENES\\r\\nWhat means Sicilia?\\r\\nHERMIONE\\r\\nHe something seems unsettled.\\r\\nPOLIXENES\\r\\nHow, my lord!\\r\\nWhat cheer? how is't with you, best brother?\\r\\nHERMIONE\\r\\nYou look as if you held a brow of much distraction\\r\\nAre you moved, my lord?\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nNo, in good earnest.\\r\\nHow sometimes nature will betray its folly,\\r\\nIts tenderness, and make itself a pastime\\r\\nTo harder bosoms! Looking on the lines\\r\\nOf my boy's face, methoughts I did recoil\\r\\nTwenty-three years, and saw myself unbreech'd,\\r\\nIn my green velvet coat, my dagger muzzled,\\r\\nLest it should bite its master, and so prove,\\r\\nAs ornaments oft do, too dangerous:\\r\\nHow like, methought, I then was to this kernel,\\r\\nThis squash, this gentleman. Mine honest friend,\\r\\nWill you take eggs for money?\\r\\nMAMILLIUS\\r\\nNo, my lord, I'll fight.\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nYou will! why, happy man be's dole! My brother,\\r\\nAre you so fond of your young prince as we\\r\\nDo seem to be of ours?\\r\\nPOLIXENES\\r\\nIf at home, sir,\\r\\nHe's all my exercise, my mirth, my matter,\\r\\nNow my sworn friend and then mine enemy,\\r\\nMy parasite, my soldier, statesman, all:\\r\\nHe makes a July's day short as December,\\r\\nAnd with his varying childness cures in me\\r\\nThoughts that would thick my blood.\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nSo stands this squire\\r\\nOfficed with me: we two will walk, my lord,\\r\\nAnd leave you to your graver steps. Hermione,\\r\\nHow thou lovest us, show in our brother's welcome;\\r\\nLet what is dear in Sicily be cheap:\\r\\nNext to thyself and my young rover, he's\\r\\nApparent to my heart.\\r\\nHERMIONE\\r\\nIf you would seek us,\\r\\nWe are yours i' the garden: shall's attend you there?\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nTo your own bents dispose you: you'll be found,\\r\\nBe you beneath the sky.\\r\\nAside\\r\\n\\r\\nI am angling now,\\r\\nThough you perceive me not how I give line.\\r\\nGo to, go to!\\r\\nHow she holds up the neb, the bill to him!\\r\\nAnd arms her with the boldness of a wife\\r\\nTo her allowing husband!\\r\\nExeunt POLIXENES, HERMIONE, and Attendants\\r\\n\\r\\nGone already!\\r\\nInch-thick, knee-deep, o'er head and\\r\\nears a fork'd one!\\r\\nGo, play, boy, play: thy mother plays, and I\\r\\nPlay too, but so disgraced a part, whose issue\\r\\nWill hiss me to my grave: contempt and clamour\\r\\nWill be my knell. Go, play, boy, play.\\r\\nThere have been,\\r\\nOr I am much deceived, cuckolds ere now;\\r\\nAnd many a man there is, even at this present,\\r\\nNow while I speak this, holds his wife by the arm,\\r\\nThat little thinks she has been sluiced in's absence\\r\\nAnd his pond fish'd by his next neighbour, by\\r\\nSir Smile, his neighbour: nay, there's comfort in't\\r\\nWhiles other men have gates and those gates open'd,\\r\\nAs mine, against their will. Should all despair\\r\\nThat have revolted wives, the tenth of mankind\\r\\nWould hang themselves. Physic for't there is none;\\r\\nIt is a bawdy planet, that will strike\\r\\nWhere 'tis predominant; and 'tis powerful, think it,\\r\\nFrom east, west, north and south: be it concluded,\\r\\nNo barricado for a belly; know't;\\r\\nIt will let in and out the enemy\\r\\nWith bag and baggage: many thousand on's\\r\\nHave the disease, and feel't not. How now, boy!\\r\\nMAMILLIUS\\r\\nI am like you, they say.\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nWhy that's some comfort. What, Camillo there?\\r\\nCAMILLO\\r\\nAy, my good lord.\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nGo play, Mamillius; thou'rt an honest man.\\r\\nExit MAMILLIUS\\r\\n\\r\\nCamillo, this great sir will yet stay longer.\\r\\nCAMILLO\\r\\nYou had much ado to make his anchor hold:\\r\\nWhen you cast out, it still came home.\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nDidst note it?\\r\\nCAMILLO\\r\\nHe would not stay at your petitions: made\\r\\nHis business more material.\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nDidst perceive it?\\r\\nAside\\r\\n\\r\\nThey're here with me already, whispering, rounding\\r\\n'Sicilia is a so-forth:' 'tis far gone,\\r\\nWhen I shall gust it last. How came't, Camillo,\\r\\nThat he did stay?\\r\\nCAMILLO\\r\\nAt the good queen's entreaty.\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nAt the queen's be't: 'good' should be pertinent\\r\\nBut, so it is, it is not. Was this taken\\r\\nBy any understanding pate but thine?\\r\\nFor thy conceit is soaking, will draw in\\r\\nMore than the common blocks: not noted, is't,\\r\\nBut of the finer natures? by some severals\\r\\nOf head-piece extraordinary? lower messes\\r\\nPerchance are to this business purblind? say.\\r\\nCAMILLO\\r\\nBusiness, my lord! I think most understand\\r\\nBohemia stays here longer.\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nHa!\\r\\nCAMILLO\\r\\nStays here longer.\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nAy, but why?\\r\\nCAMILLO\\r\\nTo satisfy your highness and the entreaties\\r\\nOf our most gracious mistress.\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nSatisfy!\\r\\nThe entreaties of your mistress! satisfy!\\r\\nLet that suffice. I have trusted thee, Camillo,\\r\\nWith all the nearest things to my heart, as well\\r\\nMy chamber-councils, wherein, priest-like, thou\\r\\nHast cleansed my bosom, I from thee departed\\r\\nThy penitent reform'd: but we have been\\r\\nDeceived in thy integrity, deceived\\r\\nIn that which seems so.\\r\\nCAMILLO\\r\\nBe it forbid, my lord!\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nTo bide upon't, thou art not honest, or,\\r\\nIf thou inclinest that way, thou art a coward,\\r\\nWhich hoxes honesty behind, restraining\\r\\nFrom course required; or else thou must be counted\\r\\nA servant grafted in my serious trust\\r\\nAnd therein negligent; or else a fool\\r\\nThat seest a game play'd home, the rich stake drawn,\\r\\nAnd takest it all for jest.\\r\\nCAMILLO\\r\\nMy gracious lord,\\r\\nI may be negligent, foolish and fearful;\\r\\nIn every one of these no man is free,\\r\\nBut that his negligence, his folly, fear,\\r\\nAmong the infinite doings of the world,\\r\\nSometime puts forth. In your affairs, my lord,\\r\\nIf ever I were wilful-negligent,\\r\\nIt was my folly; if industriously\\r\\nI play'd the fool, it was my negligence,\\r\\nNot weighing well the end; if ever fearful\\r\\nTo do a thing, where I the issue doubted,\\r\\nWhere of the execution did cry out\\r\\nAgainst the non-performance, 'twas a fear\\r\\nWhich oft infects the wisest: these, my lord,\\r\\nAre such allow'd infirmities that honesty\\r\\nIs never free of. But, beseech your grace,\\r\\nBe plainer with me; let me know my trespass\\r\\nBy its own visage: if I then deny it,\\r\\n'Tis none of mine.\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nHa' not you seen, Camillo,--\\r\\nBut that's past doubt, you have, or your eye-glass\\r\\nIs thicker than a cuckold's horn,--or heard,--\\r\\nFor to a vision so apparent rumour\\r\\nCannot be mute,--or thought,--for cogitation\\r\\nResides not in that man that does not think,--\\r\\nMy wife is slippery? If thou wilt confess,\\r\\nOr else be impudently negative,\\r\\nTo have nor eyes nor ears nor thought, then say\\r\\nMy wife's a hobby-horse, deserves a name\\r\\nAs rank as any flax-wench that puts to\\r\\nBefore her troth-plight: say't and justify't.\\r\\nCAMILLO\\r\\nI would not be a stander-by to hear\\r\\nMy sovereign mistress clouded so, without\\r\\nMy present vengeance taken: 'shrew my heart,\\r\\nYou never spoke what did become you less\\r\\nThan this; which to reiterate were sin\\r\\nAs deep as that, though true.\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nIs whispering nothing?\\r\\nIs leaning cheek to cheek? is meeting noses?\\r\\nKissing with inside lip? stopping the career\\r\\nOf laughing with a sigh?--a note infallible\\r\\nOf breaking honesty--horsing foot on foot?\\r\\nSkulking in corners? wishing clocks more swift?\\r\\nHours, minutes? noon, midnight? and all eyes\\r\\nBlind with the pin and web but theirs, theirs only,\\r\\nThat would unseen be wicked? is this nothing?\\r\\nWhy, then the world and all that's in't is nothing;\\r\\nThe covering sky is nothing; Bohemia nothing;\\r\\nMy wife is nothing; nor nothing have these nothings,\\r\\nIf this be nothing.\\r\\nCAMILLO\\r\\nGood my lord, be cured\\r\\nOf this diseased opinion, and betimes;\\r\\nFor 'tis most dangerous.\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nSay it be, 'tis true.\\r\\nCAMILLO\\r\\nNo, no, my lord.\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nIt is; you lie, you lie:\\r\\nI say thou liest, Camillo, and I hate thee,\\r\\nPronounce thee a gross lout, a mindless slave,\\r\\nOr else a hovering temporizer, that\\r\\nCanst with thine eyes at once see good and evil,\\r\\nInclining to them both: were my wife's liver\\r\\nInfected as her life, she would not live\\r\\nThe running of one glass.\\r\\nCAMILLO\\r\\nWho does infect her?\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nWhy, he that wears her like a medal, hanging\\r\\nAbout his neck, Bohemia: who, if I\\r\\nHad servants true about me, that bare eyes\\r\\nTo see alike mine honour as their profits,\\r\\nTheir own particular thrifts, they would do that\\r\\nWhich should undo more doing: ay, and thou,\\r\\nHis cupbearer,--whom I from meaner form\\r\\nHave benched and reared to worship, who mayst see\\r\\nPlainly as heaven sees earth and earth sees heaven,\\r\\nHow I am galled,--mightst bespice a cup,\\r\\nTo give mine enemy a lasting wink;\\r\\nWhich draught to me were cordial.\\r\\nCAMILLO\\r\\nSir, my lord,\\r\\nI could do this, and that with no rash potion,\\r\\nBut with a lingering dram that should not work\\r\\nMaliciously like poison: but I cannot\\r\\nBelieve this crack to be in my dread mistress,\\r\\nSo sovereignly being honourable.\\r\\nI have loved thee,--\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nMake that thy question, and go rot!\\r\\nDost think I am so muddy, so unsettled,\\r\\nTo appoint myself in this vexation, sully\\r\\nThe purity and whiteness of my sheets,\\r\\nWhich to preserve is sleep, which being spotted\\r\\nIs goads, thorns, nettles, tails of wasps,\\r\\nGive scandal to the blood o' the prince my son,\\r\\nWho I do think is mine and love as mine,\\r\\nWithout ripe moving to't? Would I do this?\\r\\nCould man so blench?\\r\\nCAMILLO\\r\\nI must believe you, sir:\\r\\nI do; and will fetch off Bohemia for't;\\r\\nProvided that, when he's removed, your highness\\r\\nWill take again your queen as yours at first,\\r\\nEven for your son's sake; and thereby for sealing\\r\\nThe injury of tongues in courts and kingdoms\\r\\nKnown and allied to yours.\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nThou dost advise me\\r\\nEven so as I mine own course have set down:\\r\\nI'll give no blemish to her honour, none.\\r\\nCAMILLO\\r\\nMy lord,\\r\\nGo then; and with a countenance as clear\\r\\nAs friendship wears at feasts, keep with Bohemia\\r\\nAnd with your queen. I am his cupbearer:\\r\\nIf from me he have wholesome beverage,\\r\\nAccount me not your servant.\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nThis is all:\\r\\nDo't and thou hast the one half of my heart;\\r\\nDo't not, thou split'st thine own.\\r\\nCAMILLO\\r\\nI'll do't, my lord.\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nI will seem friendly, as thou hast advised me.\\r\\nExit\\r\\n\\r\\nCAMILLO\\r\\nO miserable lady! But, for me,\\r\\nWhat case stand I in? I must be the poisoner\\r\\nOf good Polixenes; and my ground to do't\\r\\nIs the obedience to a master, one\\r\\nWho in rebellion with himself will have\\r\\nAll that are his so too. To do this deed,\\r\\nPromotion follows. If I could find example\\r\\nOf thousands that had struck anointed kings\\r\\nAnd flourish'd after, I'ld not do't; but since\\r\\nNor brass nor stone nor parchment bears not one,\\r\\nLet villany itself forswear't. I must\\r\\nForsake the court: to do't, or no, is certain\\r\\nTo me a break-neck. Happy star, reign now!\\r\\nHere comes Bohemia.\\r\\nRe-enter POLIXENES\\r\\n\\r\\nPOLIXENES\\r\\nThis is strange: methinks\\r\\nMy favour here begins to warp. Not speak?\\r\\nGood day, Camillo.\\r\\nCAMILLO\\r\\nHail, most royal sir!\\r\\nPOLIXENES\\r\\nWhat is the news i' the court?\\r\\nCAMILLO\\r\\nNone rare, my lord.\\r\\nPOLIXENES\\r\\nThe king hath on him such a countenance\\r\\nAs he had lost some province and a region\\r\\nLoved as he loves himself: even now I met him\\r\\nWith customary compliment; when he,\\r\\nWafting his eyes to the contrary and falling\\r\\nA lip of much contempt, speeds from me and\\r\\nSo leaves me to consider what is breeding\\r\\nThat changeth thus his manners.\\r\\nCAMILLO\\r\\nI dare not know, my lord.\\r\\nPOLIXENES\\r\\nHow! dare not! do not. Do you know, and dare not?\\r\\nBe intelligent to me: 'tis thereabouts;\\r\\nFor, to yourself, what you do know, you must.\\r\\nAnd cannot say, you dare not. Good Camillo,\\r\\nYour changed complexions are to me a mirror\\r\\nWhich shows me mine changed too; for I must be\\r\\nA party in this alteration, finding\\r\\nMyself thus alter'd with 't.\\r\\nCAMILLO\\r\\nThere is a sickness\\r\\nWhich puts some of us in distemper, but\\r\\nI cannot name the disease; and it is caught\\r\\nOf you that yet are well.\\r\\nPOLIXENES\\r\\nHow! caught of me!\\r\\nMake me not sighted like the basilisk:\\r\\nI have look'd on thousands, who have sped the better\\r\\nBy my regard, but kill'd none so. Camillo,--\\r\\nAs you are certainly a gentleman, thereto\\r\\nClerk-like experienced, which no less adorns\\r\\nOur gentry than our parents' noble names,\\r\\nIn whose success we are gentle,--I beseech you,\\r\\nIf you know aught which does behove my knowledge\\r\\nThereof to be inform'd, imprison't not\\r\\nIn ignorant concealment.\\r\\nCAMILLO\\r\\nI may not answer.\\r\\nPOLIXENES\\r\\nA sickness caught of me, and yet I well!\\r\\nI must be answer'd. Dost thou hear, Camillo,\\r\\nI conjure thee, by all the parts of man\\r\\nWhich honour does acknowledge, whereof the least\\r\\nIs not this suit of mine, that thou declare\\r\\nWhat incidency thou dost guess of harm\\r\\nIs creeping toward me; how far off, how near;\\r\\nWhich way to be prevented, if to be;\\r\\nIf not, how best to bear it.\\r\\nCAMILLO\\r\\nSir, I will tell you;\\r\\nSince I am charged in honour and by him\\r\\nThat I think honourable: therefore mark my counsel,\\r\\nWhich must be even as swiftly follow'd as\\r\\nI mean to utter it, or both yourself and me\\r\\nCry lost, and so good night!\\r\\nPOLIXENES\\r\\nOn, good Camillo.\\r\\nCAMILLO\\r\\nI am appointed him to murder you.\\r\\nPOLIXENES\\r\\nBy whom, Camillo?\\r\\nCAMILLO\\r\\nBy the king.\\r\\nPOLIXENES\\r\\nFor what?\\r\\nCAMILLO\\r\\nHe thinks, nay, with all confidence he swears,\\r\\nAs he had seen't or been an instrument\\r\\nTo vice you to't, that you have touch'd his queen\\r\\nForbiddenly.\\r\\nPOLIXENES\\r\\nO, then my best blood turn\\r\\nTo an infected jelly and my name\\r\\nBe yoked with his that did betray the Best!\\r\\nTurn then my freshest reputation to\\r\\nA savour that may strike the dullest nostril\\r\\nWhere I arrive, and my approach be shunn'd,\\r\\nNay, hated too, worse than the great'st infection\\r\\nThat e'er was heard or read!\\r\\nCAMILLO\\r\\nSwear his thought over\\r\\nBy each particular star in heaven and\\r\\nBy all their influences, you may as well\\r\\nForbid the sea for to obey the moon\\r\\nAs or by oath remove or counsel shake\\r\\nThe fabric of his folly, whose foundation\\r\\nIs piled upon his faith and will continue\\r\\nThe standing of his body.\\r\\nPOLIXENES\\r\\nHow should this grow?\\r\\nCAMILLO\\r\\nI know not: but I am sure 'tis safer to\\r\\nAvoid what's grown than question how 'tis born.\\r\\nIf therefore you dare trust my honesty,\\r\\nThat lies enclosed in this trunk which you\\r\\nShall bear along impawn'd, away to-night!\\r\\nYour followers I will whisper to the business,\\r\\nAnd will by twos and threes at several posterns\\r\\nClear them o' the city. For myself, I'll put\\r\\nMy fortunes to your service, which are here\\r\\nBy this discovery lost. Be not uncertain;\\r\\nFor, by the honour of my parents, I\\r\\nHave utter'd truth: which if you seek to prove,\\r\\nI dare not stand by; nor shall you be safer\\r\\nThan one condemn'd by the king's own mouth, thereon\\r\\nHis execution sworn.\\r\\nPOLIXENES\\r\\nI do believe thee:\\r\\nI saw his heart in 's face. Give me thy hand:\\r\\nBe pilot to me and thy places shall\\r\\nStill neighbour mine. My ships are ready and\\r\\nMy people did expect my hence departure\\r\\nTwo days ago. This jealousy\\r\\nIs for a precious creature: as she's rare,\\r\\nMust it be great, and as his person's mighty,\\r\\nMust it be violent, and as he does conceive\\r\\nHe is dishonour'd by a man which ever\\r\\nProfess'd to him, why, his revenges must\\r\\nIn that be made more bitter. Fear o'ershades me:\\r\\nGood expedition be my friend, and comfort\\r\\nThe gracious queen, part of his theme, but nothing\\r\\nOf his ill-ta'en suspicion! Come, Camillo;\\r\\nI will respect thee as a father if\\r\\nThou bear'st my life off hence: let us avoid.\\r\\nCAMILLO\\r\\nIt is in mine authority to command\\r\\nThe keys of all the posterns: please your highness\\r\\nTo take the urgent hour. Come, sir, away.\\r\\nExeunt\\r\\n\\r\\nACT II\\r\\nSCENE I. A room in LEONTES' palace.\\r\\nEnter HERMIONE, MAMILLIUS, and Ladies\\r\\nHERMIONE\\r\\nTake the boy to you: he so troubles me,\\r\\n'Tis past enduring.\\r\\nFirst Lady\\r\\nCome, my gracious lord,\\r\\nShall I be your playfellow?\\r\\nMAMILLIUS\\r\\nNo, I'll none of you.\\r\\nFirst Lady\\r\\nWhy, my sweet lord?\\r\\nMAMILLIUS\\r\\nYou'll kiss me hard and speak to me as if\\r\\nI were a baby still. I love you better.\\r\\nSecond Lady\\r\\nAnd why so, my lord?\\r\\nMAMILLIUS\\r\\nNot for because\\r\\nYour brows are blacker; yet black brows, they say,\\r\\nBecome some women best, so that there be not\\r\\nToo much hair there, but in a semicircle\\r\\nOr a half-moon made with a pen.\\r\\nSecond Lady\\r\\nWho taught you this?\\r\\nMAMILLIUS\\r\\nI learnt it out of women's faces. Pray now\\r\\nWhat colour are your eyebrows?\\r\\nFirst Lady\\r\\nBlue, my lord.\\r\\nMAMILLIUS\\r\\nNay, that's a mock: I have seen a lady's nose\\r\\nThat has been blue, but not her eyebrows.\\r\\nFirst Lady\\r\\nHark ye;\\r\\nThe queen your mother rounds apace: we shall\\r\\nPresent our services to a fine new prince\\r\\nOne of these days; and then you'ld wanton with us,\\r\\nIf we would have you.\\r\\nSecond Lady\\r\\nShe is spread of late\\r\\nInto a goodly bulk: good time encounter her!\\r\\nHERMIONE\\r\\nWhat wisdom stirs amongst you? Come, sir, now\\r\\nI am for you again: pray you, sit by us,\\r\\nAnd tell 's a tale.\\r\\nMAMILLIUS\\r\\nMerry or sad shall't be?\\r\\nHERMIONE\\r\\nAs merry as you will.\\r\\nMAMILLIUS\\r\\nA sad tale's best for winter: I have one\\r\\nOf sprites and goblins.\\r\\nHERMIONE\\r\\nLet's have that, good sir.\\r\\nCome on, sit down: come on, and do your best\\r\\nTo fright me with your sprites; you're powerful at it.\\r\\nMAMILLIUS\\r\\nThere was a man--\\r\\nHERMIONE\\r\\nNay, come, sit down; then on.\\r\\nMAMILLIUS\\r\\nDwelt by a churchyard: I will tell it softly;\\r\\nYond crickets shall not hear it.\\r\\nHERMIONE\\r\\nCome on, then,\\r\\nAnd give't me in mine ear.\\r\\nEnter LEONTES, with ANTIGONUS, Lords and others\\r\\n\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nWas he met there? his train? Camillo with him?\\r\\nFirst Lord\\r\\nBehind the tuft of pines I met them; never\\r\\nSaw I men scour so on their way: I eyed them\\r\\nEven to their ships.\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nHow blest am I\\r\\nIn my just censure, in my true opinion!\\r\\nAlack, for lesser knowledge! how accursed\\r\\nIn being so blest! There may be in the cup\\r\\nA spider steep'd, and one may drink, depart,\\r\\nAnd yet partake no venom, for his knowledge\\r\\nIs not infected: but if one present\\r\\nThe abhorr'd ingredient to his eye, make known\\r\\nHow he hath drunk, he cracks his gorge, his sides,\\r\\nWith violent hefts. I have drunk,\\r\\nand seen the spider.\\r\\nCamillo was his help in this, his pander:\\r\\nThere is a plot against my life, my crown;\\r\\nAll's true that is mistrusted: that false villain\\r\\nWhom I employ'd was pre-employ'd by him:\\r\\nHe has discover'd my design, and I\\r\\nRemain a pinch'd thing; yea, a very trick\\r\\nFor them to play at will. How came the posterns\\r\\nSo easily open?\\r\\nFirst Lord\\r\\nBy his great authority;\\r\\nWhich often hath no less prevail'd than so\\r\\nOn your command.\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nI know't too well.\\r\\nGive me the boy: I am glad you did not nurse him:\\r\\nThough he does bear some signs of me, yet you\\r\\nHave too much blood in him.\\r\\nHERMIONE\\r\\nWhat is this? sport?\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nBear the boy hence; he shall not come about her;\\r\\nAway with him! and let her sport herself\\r\\nWith that she's big with; for 'tis Polixenes\\r\\nHas made thee swell thus.\\r\\nHERMIONE\\r\\nBut I'ld say he had not,\\r\\nAnd I'll be sworn you would believe my saying,\\r\\nHowe'er you lean to the nayward.\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nYou, my lords,\\r\\nLook on her, mark her well; be but about\\r\\nTo say 'she is a goodly lady,' and\\r\\nThe justice of your bearts will thereto add\\r\\n'Tis pity she's not honest, honourable:'\\r\\nPraise her but for this her without-door form,\\r\\nWhich on my faith deserves high speech, and straight\\r\\nThe shrug, the hum or ha, these petty brands\\r\\nThat calumny doth use--O, I am out--\\r\\nThat mercy does, for calumny will sear\\r\\nVirtue itself: these shrugs, these hums and ha's,\\r\\nWhen you have said 'she's goodly,' come between\\r\\nEre you can say 'she's honest:' but be 't known,\\r\\nFrom him that has most cause to grieve it should be,\\r\\nShe's an adulteress.\\r\\nHERMIONE\\r\\nShould a villain say so,\\r\\nThe most replenish'd villain in the world,\\r\\nHe were as much more villain: you, my lord,\\r\\nDo but mistake.\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nYou have mistook, my lady,\\r\\nPolixenes for Leontes: O thou thing!\\r\\nWhich I'll not call a creature of thy place,\\r\\nLest barbarism, making me the precedent,\\r\\nShould a like language use to all degrees\\r\\nAnd mannerly distinguishment leave out\\r\\nBetwixt the prince and beggar: I have said\\r\\nShe's an adulteress; I have said with whom:\\r\\nMore, she's a traitor and Camillo is\\r\\nA federary with her, and one that knows\\r\\nWhat she should shame to know herself\\r\\nBut with her most vile principal, that she's\\r\\nA bed-swerver, even as bad as those\\r\\nThat vulgars give bold'st titles, ay, and privy\\r\\nTo this their late escape.\\r\\nHERMIONE\\r\\nNo, by my life.\\r\\nPrivy to none of this. How will this grieve you,\\r\\nWhen you shall come to clearer knowledge, that\\r\\nYou thus have publish'd me! Gentle my lord,\\r\\nYou scarce can right me throughly then to say\\r\\nYou did mistake.\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nNo; if I mistake\\r\\nIn those foundations which I build upon,\\r\\nThe centre is not big enough to bear\\r\\nA school-boy's top. Away with her! to prison!\\r\\nHe who shall speak for her is afar off guilty\\r\\nBut that he speaks.\\r\\nHERMIONE\\r\\nThere's some ill planet reigns:\\r\\nI must be patient till the heavens look\\r\\nWith an aspect more favourable. Good my lords,\\r\\nI am not prone to weeping, as our sex\\r\\nCommonly are; the want of which vain dew\\r\\nPerchance shall dry your pities: but I have\\r\\nThat honourable grief lodged here which burns\\r\\nWorse than tears drown: beseech you all, my lords,\\r\\nWith thoughts so qualified as your charities\\r\\nShall best instruct you, measure me; and so\\r\\nThe king's will be perform'd!\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nShall I be heard?\\r\\nHERMIONE\\r\\nWho is't that goes with me? Beseech your highness,\\r\\nMy women may be with me; for you see\\r\\nMy plight requires it. Do not weep, good fools;\\r\\nThere is no cause: when you shall know your mistress\\r\\nHas deserved prison, then abound in tears\\r\\nAs I come out: this action I now go on\\r\\nIs for my better grace. Adieu, my lord:\\r\\nI never wish'd to see you sorry; now\\r\\nI trust I shall. My women, come; you have leave.\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nGo, do our bidding; hence!\\r\\nExit HERMIONE, guarded; with Ladies\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst Lord\\r\\nBeseech your highness, call the queen again.\\r\\nANTIGONUS\\r\\nBe certain what you do, sir, lest your justice\\r\\nProve violence; in the which three great ones suffer,\\r\\nYourself, your queen, your son.\\r\\nFirst Lord\\r\\nFor her, my lord,\\r\\nI dare my life lay down and will do't, sir,\\r\\nPlease you to accept it, that the queen is spotless\\r\\nI' the eyes of heaven and to you; I mean,\\r\\nIn this which you accuse her.\\r\\nANTIGONUS\\r\\nIf it prove\\r\\nShe's otherwise, I'll keep my stables where\\r\\nI lodge my wife; I'll go in couples with her;\\r\\nThan when I feel and see her no farther trust her;\\r\\nFor every inch of woman in the world,\\r\\nAy, every dram of woman's flesh is false, If she be.\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nHold your peaces.\\r\\nFirst Lord\\r\\nGood my lord,--\\r\\nANTIGONUS\\r\\nIt is for you we speak, not for ourselves:\\r\\nYou are abused and by some putter-on\\r\\nThat will be damn'd for't; would I knew the villain,\\r\\nI would land-damn him. Be she honour-flaw'd,\\r\\nI have three daughters; the eldest is eleven\\r\\nThe second and the third, nine, and some five;\\r\\nIf this prove true, they'll pay for't:\\r\\nby mine honour,\\r\\nI'll geld 'em all; fourteen they shall not see,\\r\\nTo bring false generations: they are co-heirs;\\r\\nAnd I had rather glib myself than they\\r\\nShould not produce fair issue.\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nCease; no more.\\r\\nYou smell this business with a sense as cold\\r\\nAs is a dead man's nose: but I do see't and feel't\\r\\nAs you feel doing thus; and see withal\\r\\nThe instruments that feel.\\r\\nANTIGONUS\\r\\nIf it be so,\\r\\nWe need no grave to bury honesty:\\r\\nThere's not a grain of it the face to sweeten\\r\\nOf the whole dungy earth.\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nWhat! lack I credit?\\r\\nFirst Lord\\r\\nI had rather you did lack than I, my lord,\\r\\nUpon this ground; and more it would content me\\r\\nTo have her honour true than your suspicion,\\r\\nBe blamed for't how you might.\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nWhy, what need we\\r\\nCommune with you of this, but rather follow\\r\\nOur forceful instigation? Our prerogative\\r\\nCalls not your counsels, but our natural goodness\\r\\nImparts this; which if you, or stupefied\\r\\nOr seeming so in skill, cannot or will not\\r\\nRelish a truth like us, inform yourselves\\r\\nWe need no more of your advice: the matter,\\r\\nThe loss, the gain, the ordering on't, is all\\r\\nProperly ours.\\r\\nANTIGONUS\\r\\nAnd I wish, my liege,\\r\\nYou had only in your silent judgment tried it,\\r\\nWithout more overture.\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nHow could that be?\\r\\nEither thou art most ignorant by age,\\r\\nOr thou wert born a fool. Camillo's flight,\\r\\nAdded to their familiarity,\\r\\nWhich was as gross as ever touch'd conjecture,\\r\\nThat lack'd sight only, nought for approbation\\r\\nBut only seeing, all other circumstances\\r\\nMade up to the deed, doth push on this proceeding:\\r\\nYet, for a greater confirmation,\\r\\nFor in an act of this importance 'twere\\r\\nMost piteous to be wild, I have dispatch'd in post\\r\\nTo sacred Delphos, to Apollo's temple,\\r\\nCleomenes and Dion, whom you know\\r\\nOf stuff'd sufficiency: now from the oracle\\r\\nThey will bring all; whose spiritual counsel had,\\r\\nShall stop or spur me. Have I done well?\\r\\nFirst Lord\\r\\nWell done, my lord.\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nThough I am satisfied and need no more\\r\\nThan what I know, yet shall the oracle\\r\\nGive rest to the minds of others, such as he\\r\\nWhose ignorant credulity will not\\r\\nCome up to the truth. So have we thought it good\\r\\nFrom our free person she should be confined,\\r\\nLest that the treachery of the two fled hence\\r\\nBe left her to perform. Come, follow us;\\r\\nWe are to speak in public; for this business\\r\\nWill raise us all.\\r\\nANTIGONUS\\r\\n[Aside]\\r\\nTo laughter, as I take it,\\r\\nIf the good truth were known.\\r\\nExeunt\\r\\n\\r\\nSCENE II. A prison.\\r\\nEnter PAULINA, a Gentleman, and Attendants\\r\\nPAULINA\\r\\nThe keeper of the prison, call to him;\\r\\nlet him have knowledge who I am.\\r\\nExit Gentleman\\r\\n\\r\\nGood lady,\\r\\nNo court in Europe is too good for thee;\\r\\nWhat dost thou then in prison?\\r\\nRe-enter Gentleman, with the Gaoler\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, good sir,\\r\\nYou know me, do you not?\\r\\nGaoler\\r\\nFor a worthy lady\\r\\nAnd one whom much I honour.\\r\\nPAULINA\\r\\nPray you then,\\r\\nConduct me to the queen.\\r\\nGaoler\\r\\nI may not, madam:\\r\\nTo the contrary I have express commandment.\\r\\nPAULINA\\r\\nHere's ado,\\r\\nTo lock up honesty and honour from\\r\\nThe access of gentle visitors!\\r\\nIs't lawful, pray you,\\r\\nTo see her women? any of them? Emilia?\\r\\nGaoler\\r\\nSo please you, madam,\\r\\nTo put apart these your attendants, I\\r\\nShall bring Emilia forth.\\r\\nPAULINA\\r\\nI pray now, call her.\\r\\nWithdraw yourselves.\\r\\nExeunt Gentleman and Attendants\\r\\n\\r\\nGaoler\\r\\nAnd, madam,\\r\\nI must be present at your conference.\\r\\nPAULINA\\r\\nWell, be't so, prithee.\\r\\nExit Gaoler\\r\\n\\r\\nHere's such ado to make no stain a stain\\r\\nAs passes colouring.\\r\\nRe-enter Gaoler, with EMILIA\\r\\n\\r\\nDear gentlewoman,\\r\\nHow fares our gracious lady?\\r\\nEMILIA\\r\\nAs well as one so great and so forlorn\\r\\nMay hold together: on her frights and griefs,\\r\\nWhich never tender lady hath born greater,\\r\\nShe is something before her time deliver'd.\\r\\nPAULINA\\r\\nA boy?\\r\\nEMILIA\\r\\nA daughter, and a goodly babe,\\r\\nLusty and like to live: the queen receives\\r\\nMuch comfort in't; says 'My poor prisoner,\\r\\nI am innocent as you.'\\r\\nPAULINA\\r\\nI dare be sworn\\r\\nThese dangerous unsafe lunes i' the king,\\r\\nbeshrew them!\\r\\nHe must be told on't, and he shall: the office\\r\\nBecomes a woman best; I'll take't upon me:\\r\\nIf I prove honey-mouth'd let my tongue blister\\r\\nAnd never to my red-look'd anger be\\r\\nThe trumpet any more. Pray you, Emilia,\\r\\nCommend my best obedience to the queen:\\r\\nIf she dares trust me with her little babe,\\r\\nI'll show't the king and undertake to be\\r\\nHer advocate to the loud'st. We do not know\\r\\nHow he may soften at the sight o' the child:\\r\\nThe silence often of pure innocence\\r\\nPersuades when speaking fails.\\r\\nEMILIA\\r\\nMost worthy madam,\\r\\nYour honour and your goodness is so evident\\r\\nThat your free undertaking cannot miss\\r\\nA thriving issue: there is no lady living\\r\\nSo meet for this great errand. Please your ladyship\\r\\nTo visit the next room, I'll presently\\r\\nAcquaint the queen of your most noble offer;\\r\\nWho but to-day hammer'd of this design,\\r\\nBut durst not tempt a minister of honour,\\r\\nLest she should be denied.\\r\\nPAULINA\\r\\nTell her, Emilia.\\r\\nI'll use that tongue I have: if wit flow from't\\r\\nAs boldness from my bosom, let 't not be doubted\\r\\nI shall do good.\\r\\nEMILIA\\r\\nNow be you blest for it!\\r\\nI'll to the queen: please you,\\r\\ncome something nearer.\\r\\nGaoler\\r\\nMadam, if't please the queen to send the babe,\\r\\nI know not what I shall incur to pass it,\\r\\nHaving no warrant.\\r\\nPAULINA\\r\\nYou need not fear it, sir:\\r\\nThis child was prisoner to the womb and is\\r\\nBy law and process of great nature thence\\r\\nFreed and enfranchised, not a party to\\r\\nThe anger of the king nor guilty of,\\r\\nIf any be, the trespass of the queen.\\r\\nGaoler\\r\\nI do believe it.\\r\\nPAULINA\\r\\nDo not you fear: upon mine honour,\\r\\nI will stand betwixt you and danger.\\r\\nExeunt\\r\\n\\r\\nSCENE III. A room in LEONTES' palace.\\r\\nEnter LEONTES, ANTIGONUS, Lords, and Servants\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nNor night nor day no rest: it is but weakness\\r\\nTo bear the matter thus; mere weakness. If\\r\\nThe cause were not in being,--part o' the cause,\\r\\nShe the adulteress; for the harlot king\\r\\nIs quite beyond mine arm, out of the blank\\r\\nAnd level of my brain, plot-proof; but she\\r\\nI can hook to me: say that she were gone,\\r\\nGiven to the fire, a moiety of my rest\\r\\nMight come to me again. Who's there?\\r\\nFirst Servant\\r\\nMy lord?\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nHow does the boy?\\r\\nFirst Servant\\r\\nHe took good rest to-night;\\r\\n'Tis hoped his sickness is discharged.\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nTo see his nobleness!\\r\\nConceiving the dishonour of his mother,\\r\\nHe straight declined, droop'd, took it deeply,\\r\\nFasten'd and fix'd the shame on't in himself,\\r\\nThrew off his spirit, his appetite, his sleep,\\r\\nAnd downright languish'd. Leave me solely: go,\\r\\nSee how he fares.\\r\\nExit Servant\\r\\n\\r\\nFie, fie! no thought of him:\\r\\nThe thought of my revenges that way\\r\\nRecoil upon me: in himself too mighty,\\r\\nAnd in his parties, his alliance; let him be\\r\\nUntil a time may serve: for present vengeance,\\r\\nTake it on her. Camillo and Polixenes\\r\\nLaugh at me, make their pastime at my sorrow:\\r\\nThey should not laugh if I could reach them, nor\\r\\nShall she within my power.\\r\\nEnter PAULINA, with a child\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst Lord\\r\\nYou must not enter.\\r\\nPAULINA\\r\\nNay, rather, good my lords, be second to me:\\r\\nFear you his tyrannous passion more, alas,\\r\\nThan the queen's life? a gracious innocent soul,\\r\\nMore free than he is jealous.\\r\\nANTIGONUS\\r\\nThat's enough.\\r\\nSecond Servant\\r\\nMadam, he hath not slept tonight; commanded\\r\\nNone should come at him.\\r\\nPAULINA\\r\\nNot so hot, good sir:\\r\\nI come to bring him sleep. 'Tis such as you,\\r\\nThat creep like shadows by him and do sigh\\r\\nAt each his needless heavings, such as you\\r\\nNourish the cause of his awaking: I\\r\\nDo come with words as medicinal as true,\\r\\nHonest as either, to purge him of that humour\\r\\nThat presses him from sleep.\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nWhat noise there, ho?\\r\\nPAULINA\\r\\nNo noise, my lord; but needful conference\\r\\nAbout some gossips for your highness.\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nHow!\\r\\nAway with that audacious lady! Antigonus,\\r\\nI charged thee that she should not come about me:\\r\\nI knew she would.\\r\\nANTIGONUS\\r\\nI told her so, my lord,\\r\\nOn your displeasure's peril and on mine,\\r\\nShe should not visit you.\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nWhat, canst not rule her?\\r\\nPAULINA\\r\\nFrom all dishonesty he can: in this,\\r\\nUnless he take the course that you have done,\\r\\nCommit me for committing honour, trust it,\\r\\nHe shall not rule me.\\r\\nANTIGONUS\\r\\nLa you now, you hear:\\r\\nWhen she will take the rein I let her run;\\r\\nBut she'll not stumble.\\r\\nPAULINA\\r\\nGood my liege, I come;\\r\\nAnd, I beseech you, hear me, who profess\\r\\nMyself your loyal servant, your physician,\\r\\nYour most obedient counsellor, yet that dare\\r\\nLess appear so in comforting your evils,\\r\\nThan such as most seem yours: I say, I come\\r\\nFrom your good queen.\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nGood queen!\\r\\nPAULINA\\r\\nGood queen, my lord,\\r\\nGood queen; I say good queen;\\r\\nAnd would by combat make her good, so were I\\r\\nA man, the worst about you.\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nForce her hence.\\r\\nPAULINA\\r\\nLet him that makes but trifles of his eyes\\r\\nFirst hand me: on mine own accord I'll off;\\r\\nBut first I'll do my errand. The good queen,\\r\\nFor she is good, hath brought you forth a daughter;\\r\\nHere 'tis; commends it to your blessing.\\r\\nLaying down the child\\r\\n\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nOut!\\r\\nA mankind witch! Hence with her, out o' door:\\r\\nA most intelligencing bawd!\\r\\nPAULINA\\r\\nNot so:\\r\\nI am as ignorant in that as you\\r\\nIn so entitling me, and no less honest\\r\\nThan you are mad; which is enough, I'll warrant,\\r\\nAs this world goes, to pass for honest.\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nTraitors!\\r\\nWill you not push her out? Give her the bastard.\\r\\nThou dotard! thou art woman-tired, unroosted\\r\\nBy thy dame Partlet here. Take up the bastard;\\r\\nTake't up, I say; give't to thy crone.\\r\\nPAULINA\\r\\nFor ever\\r\\nUnvenerable be thy hands, if thou\\r\\nTakest up the princess by that forced baseness\\r\\nWhich he has put upon't!\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nHe dreads his wife.\\r\\nPAULINA\\r\\nSo I would you did; then 'twere past all doubt\\r\\nYou'ld call your children yours.\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nA nest of traitors!\\r\\nANTIGONUS\\r\\nI am none, by this good light.\\r\\nPAULINA\\r\\nNor I, nor any\\r\\nBut one that's here, and that's himself, for he\\r\\nThe sacred honour of himself, his queen's,\\r\\nHis hopeful son's, his babe's, betrays to slander,\\r\\nWhose sting is sharper than the sword's;\\r\\nand will not--\\r\\nFor, as the case now stands, it is a curse\\r\\nHe cannot be compell'd to't--once remove\\r\\nThe root of his opinion, which is rotten\\r\\nAs ever oak or stone was sound.\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nA callat\\r\\nOf boundless tongue, who late hath beat her husband\\r\\nAnd now baits me! This brat is none of mine;\\r\\nIt is the issue of Polixenes:\\r\\nHence with it, and together with the dam\\r\\nCommit them to the fire!\\r\\nPAULINA\\r\\nIt is yours;\\r\\nAnd, might we lay the old proverb to your charge,\\r\\nSo like you, 'tis the worse. Behold, my lords,\\r\\nAlthough the print be little, the whole matter\\r\\nAnd copy of the father, eye, nose, lip,\\r\\nThe trick of's frown, his forehead, nay, the valley,\\r\\nThe pretty dimples of his chin and cheek,\\r\\nHis smiles,\\r\\nThe very mould and frame of hand, nail, finger:\\r\\nAnd thou, good goddess Nature, which hast made it\\r\\nSo like to him that got it, if thou hast\\r\\nThe ordering of the mind too, 'mongst all colours\\r\\nNo yellow in't, lest she suspect, as he does,\\r\\nHer children not her husband's!\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nA gross hag\\r\\nAnd, lozel, thou art worthy to be hang'd,\\r\\nThat wilt not stay her tongue.\\r\\nANTIGONUS\\r\\nHang all the husbands\\r\\nThat cannot do that feat, you'll leave yourself\\r\\nHardly one subject.\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nOnce more, take her hence.\\r\\nPAULINA\\r\\nA most unworthy and unnatural lord\\r\\nCan do no more.\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nI'll ha' thee burnt.\\r\\nPAULINA\\r\\nI care not:\\r\\nIt is an heretic that makes the fire,\\r\\nNot she which burns in't. I'll not call you tyrant;\\r\\nBut this most cruel usage of your queen,\\r\\nNot able to produce more accusation\\r\\nThan your own weak-hinged fancy, something savours\\r\\nOf tyranny and will ignoble make you,\\r\\nYea, scandalous to the world.\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nOn your allegiance,\\r\\nOut of the chamber with her! Were I a tyrant,\\r\\nWhere were her life? she durst not call me so,\\r\\nIf she did know me one. Away with her!\\r\\nPAULINA\\r\\nI pray you, do not push me; I'll be gone.\\r\\nLook to your babe, my lord; 'tis yours:\\r\\nJove send her\\r\\nA better guiding spirit! What needs these hands?\\r\\nYou, that are thus so tender o'er his follies,\\r\\nWill never do him good, not one of you.\\r\\nSo, so: farewell; we are gone.\\r\\nExit\\r\\n\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nThou, traitor, hast set on thy wife to this.\\r\\nMy child? away with't! Even thou, that hast\\r\\nA heart so tender o'er it, take it hence\\r\\nAnd see it instantly consumed with fire;\\r\\nEven thou and none but thou. Take it up straight:\\r\\nWithin this hour bring me word 'tis done,\\r\\nAnd by good testimony, or I'll seize thy life,\\r\\nWith what thou else call'st thine. If thou refuse\\r\\nAnd wilt encounter with my wrath, say so;\\r\\nThe bastard brains with these my proper hands\\r\\nShall I dash out. Go, take it to the fire;\\r\\nFor thou set'st on thy wife.\\r\\nANTIGONUS\\r\\nI did not, sir:\\r\\nThese lords, my noble fellows, if they please,\\r\\nCan clear me in't.\\r\\nLords\\r\\nWe can: my royal liege,\\r\\nHe is not guilty of her coming hither.\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nYou're liars all.\\r\\nFirst Lord\\r\\nBeseech your highness, give us better credit:\\r\\nWe have always truly served you, and beseech you\\r\\nSo to esteem of us, and on our knees we beg,\\r\\nAs recompense of our dear services\\r\\nPast and to come, that you do change this purpose,\\r\\nWhich being so horrible, so bloody, must\\r\\nLead on to some foul issue: we all kneel.\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nI am a feather for each wind that blows:\\r\\nShall I live on to see this bastard kneel\\r\\nAnd call me father? better burn it now\\r\\nThan curse it then. But be it; let it live.\\r\\nIt shall not neither. You, sir, come you hither;\\r\\nYou that have been so tenderly officious\\r\\nWith Lady Margery, your midwife there,\\r\\nTo save this bastard's life,--for 'tis a bastard,\\r\\nSo sure as this beard's grey,\\r\\n--what will you adventure\\r\\nTo save this brat's life?\\r\\nANTIGONUS\\r\\nAny thing, my lord,\\r\\nThat my ability may undergo\\r\\nAnd nobleness impose: at least thus much:\\r\\nI'll pawn the little blood which I have left\\r\\nTo save the innocent: any thing possible.\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nIt shall be possible. Swear by this sword\\r\\nThou wilt perform my bidding.\\r\\nANTIGONUS\\r\\nI will, my lord.\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nMark and perform it, see'st thou! for the fail\\r\\nOf any point in't shall not only be\\r\\nDeath to thyself but to thy lewd-tongued wife,\\r\\nWhom for this time we pardon. We enjoin thee,\\r\\nAs thou art liege-man to us, that thou carry\\r\\nThis female bastard hence and that thou bear it\\r\\nTo some remote and desert place quite out\\r\\nOf our dominions, and that there thou leave it,\\r\\nWithout more mercy, to its own protection\\r\\nAnd favour of the climate. As by strange fortune\\r\\nIt came to us, I do in justice charge thee,\\r\\nOn thy soul's peril and thy body's torture,\\r\\nThat thou commend it strangely to some place\\r\\nWhere chance may nurse or end it. Take it up.\\r\\nANTIGONUS\\r\\nI swear to do this, though a present death\\r\\nHad been more merciful. Come on, poor babe:\\r\\nSome powerful spirit instruct the kites and ravens\\r\\nTo be thy nurses! Wolves and bears, they say\\r\\nCasting their savageness aside have done\\r\\nLike offices of pity. Sir, be prosperous\\r\\nIn more than this deed does require! And blessing\\r\\nAgainst this cruelty fight on thy side,\\r\\nPoor thing, condemn'd to loss!\\r\\nExit with the child\\r\\n\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nNo, I'll not rear\\r\\nAnother's issue.\\r\\nEnter a Servant\\r\\n\\r\\nServant\\r\\nPlease your highness, posts\\r\\nFrom those you sent to the oracle are come\\r\\nAn hour since: Cleomenes and Dion,\\r\\nBeing well arrived from Delphos, are both landed,\\r\\nHasting to the court.\\r\\nFirst Lord\\r\\nSo please you, sir, their speed\\r\\nHath been beyond account.\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nTwenty-three days\\r\\nThey have been absent: 'tis good speed; foretells\\r\\nThe great Apollo suddenly will have\\r\\nThe truth of this appear. Prepare you, lords;\\r\\nSummon a session, that we may arraign\\r\\nOur most disloyal lady, for, as she hath\\r\\nBeen publicly accused, so shall she have\\r\\nA just and open trial. While she lives\\r\\nMy heart will be a burthen to me. Leave me,\\r\\nAnd think upon my bidding.\\r\\nExeunt\\r\\n\\r\\nACT III\\r\\nSCENE I. A sea-port in Sicilia.\\r\\nEnter CLEOMENES and DION\\r\\nCLEOMENES\\r\\nThe climate's delicate, the air most sweet,\\r\\nFertile the isle, the temple much surpassing\\r\\nThe common praise it bears.\\r\\nDION\\r\\nI shall report,\\r\\nFor most it caught me, the celestial habits,\\r\\nMethinks I so should term them, and the reverence\\r\\nOf the grave wearers. O, the sacrifice!\\r\\nHow ceremonious, solemn and unearthly\\r\\nIt was i' the offering!\\r\\nCLEOMENES\\r\\nBut of all, the burst\\r\\nAnd the ear-deafening voice o' the oracle,\\r\\nKin to Jove's thunder, so surprised my sense.\\r\\nThat I was nothing.\\r\\nDION\\r\\nIf the event o' the journey\\r\\nProve as successful to the queen,--O be't so!--\\r\\nAs it hath been to us rare, pleasant, speedy,\\r\\nThe time is worth the use on't.\\r\\nCLEOMENES\\r\\nGreat Apollo\\r\\nTurn all to the best! These proclamations,\\r\\nSo forcing faults upon Hermione,\\r\\nI little like.\\r\\nDION\\r\\nThe violent carriage of it\\r\\nWill clear or end the business: when the oracle,\\r\\nThus by Apollo's great divine seal'd up,\\r\\nShall the contents discover, something rare\\r\\nEven then will rush to knowledge. Go: fresh horses!\\r\\nAnd gracious be the issue!\\r\\nExeunt\\r\\n\\r\\nSCENE II. A court of Justice.\\r\\nEnter LEONTES, Lords, and Officers\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nThis sessions, to our great grief we pronounce,\\r\\nEven pushes 'gainst our heart: the party tried\\r\\nThe daughter of a king, our wife, and one\\r\\nOf us too much beloved. Let us be clear'd\\r\\nOf being tyrannous, since we so openly\\r\\nProceed in justice, which shall have due course,\\r\\nEven to the guilt or the purgation.\\r\\nProduce the prisoner.\\r\\nOfficer\\r\\nIt is his highness' pleasure that the queen\\r\\nAppear in person here in court. Silence!\\r\\nEnter HERMIONE guarded; PAULINA and Ladies attending\\r\\n\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nRead the indictment.\\r\\nOfficer\\r\\n[Reads] Hermione, queen to the worthy\\r\\nLeontes, king of Sicilia, thou art here accused and\\r\\narraigned of high treason, in committing adultery\\r\\nwith Polixenes, king of Bohemia, and conspiring\\r\\nwith Camillo to take away the life of our sovereign\\r\\nlord the king, thy royal husband: the pretence\\r\\nwhereof being by circumstances partly laid open,\\r\\nthou, Hermione, contrary to the faith and allegiance\\r\\nof a true subject, didst counsel and aid them, for\\r\\ntheir better safety, to fly away by night.\\r\\nHERMIONE\\r\\nSince what I am to say must be but that\\r\\nWhich contradicts my accusation and\\r\\nThe testimony on my part no other\\r\\nBut what comes from myself, it shall scarce boot me\\r\\nTo say 'not guilty:' mine integrity\\r\\nBeing counted falsehood, shall, as I express it,\\r\\nBe so received. But thus: if powers divine\\r\\nBehold our human actions, as they do,\\r\\nI doubt not then but innocence shall make\\r\\nFalse accusation blush and tyranny\\r\\nTremble at patience. You, my lord, best know,\\r\\nWho least will seem to do so, my past life\\r\\nHath been as continent, as chaste, as true,\\r\\nAs I am now unhappy; which is more\\r\\nThan history can pattern, though devised\\r\\nAnd play'd to take spectators. For behold me\\r\\nA fellow of the royal bed, which owe\\r\\nA moiety of the throne a great king's daughter,\\r\\nThe mother to a hopeful prince, here standing\\r\\nTo prate and talk for life and honour 'fore\\r\\nWho please to come and hear. For life, I prize it\\r\\nAs I weigh grief, which I would spare: for honour,\\r\\n'Tis a derivative from me to mine,\\r\\nAnd only that I stand for. I appeal\\r\\nTo your own conscience, sir, before Polixenes\\r\\nCame to your court, how I was in your grace,\\r\\nHow merited to be so; since he came,\\r\\nWith what encounter so uncurrent I\\r\\nHave strain'd to appear thus: if one jot beyond\\r\\nThe bound of honour, or in act or will\\r\\nThat way inclining, harden'd be the hearts\\r\\nOf all that hear me, and my near'st of kin\\r\\nCry fie upon my grave!\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nI ne'er heard yet\\r\\nThat any of these bolder vices wanted\\r\\nLess impudence to gainsay what they did\\r\\nThan to perform it first.\\r\\nHERMIONE\\r\\nThat's true enough;\\r\\nThrough 'tis a saying, sir, not due to me.\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nYou will not own it.\\r\\nHERMIONE\\r\\nMore than mistress of\\r\\nWhich comes to me in name of fault, I must not\\r\\nAt all acknowledge. For Polixenes,\\r\\nWith whom I am accused, I do confess\\r\\nI loved him as in honour he required,\\r\\nWith such a kind of love as might become\\r\\nA lady like me, with a love even such,\\r\\nSo and no other, as yourself commanded:\\r\\nWhich not to have done I think had been in me\\r\\nBoth disobedience and ingratitude\\r\\nTo you and toward your friend, whose love had spoke,\\r\\nEven since it could speak, from an infant, freely\\r\\nThat it was yours. Now, for conspiracy,\\r\\nI know not how it tastes; though it be dish'd\\r\\nFor me to try how: all I know of it\\r\\nIs that Camillo was an honest man;\\r\\nAnd why he left your court, the gods themselves,\\r\\nWotting no more than I, are ignorant.\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nYou knew of his departure, as you know\\r\\nWhat you have underta'en to do in's absence.\\r\\nHERMIONE\\r\\nSir,\\r\\nYou speak a language that I understand not:\\r\\nMy life stands in the level of your dreams,\\r\\nWhich I'll lay down.\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nYour actions are my dreams;\\r\\nYou had a bastard by Polixenes,\\r\\nAnd I but dream'd it. As you were past all shame,--\\r\\nThose of your fact are so--so past all truth:\\r\\nWhich to deny concerns more than avails; for as\\r\\nThy brat hath been cast out, like to itself,\\r\\nNo father owning it,--which is, indeed,\\r\\nMore criminal in thee than it,--so thou\\r\\nShalt feel our justice, in whose easiest passage\\r\\nLook for no less than death.\\r\\nHERMIONE\\r\\nSir, spare your threats:\\r\\nThe bug which you would fright me with I seek.\\r\\nTo me can life be no commodity:\\r\\nThe crown and comfort of my life, your favour,\\r\\nI do give lost; for I do feel it gone,\\r\\nBut know not how it went. My second joy\\r\\nAnd first-fruits of my body, from his presence\\r\\nI am barr'd, like one infectious. My third comfort\\r\\nStarr'd most unluckily, is from my breast,\\r\\nThe innocent milk in its most innocent mouth,\\r\\nHaled out to murder: myself on every post\\r\\nProclaimed a strumpet: with immodest hatred\\r\\nThe child-bed privilege denied, which 'longs\\r\\nTo women of all fashion; lastly, hurried\\r\\nHere to this place, i' the open air, before\\r\\nI have got strength of limit. Now, my liege,\\r\\nTell me what blessings I have here alive,\\r\\nThat I should fear to die? Therefore proceed.\\r\\nBut yet hear this: mistake me not; no life,\\r\\nI prize it not a straw, but for mine honour,\\r\\nWhich I would free, if I shall be condemn'd\\r\\nUpon surmises, all proofs sleeping else\\r\\nBut what your jealousies awake, I tell you\\r\\n'Tis rigor and not law. Your honours all,\\r\\nI do refer me to the oracle:\\r\\nApollo be my judge!\\r\\nFirst Lord\\r\\nThis your request\\r\\nIs altogether just: therefore bring forth,\\r\\nAnd in Apollos name, his oracle.\\r\\nExeunt certain Officers\\r\\n\\r\\nHERMIONE\\r\\nThe Emperor of Russia was my father:\\r\\nO that he were alive, and here beholding\\r\\nHis daughter's trial! that he did but see\\r\\nThe flatness of my misery, yet with eyes\\r\\nOf pity, not revenge!\\r\\nRe-enter Officers, with CLEOMENES and DION\\r\\n\\r\\nOfficer\\r\\nYou here shall swear upon this sword of justice,\\r\\nThat you, Cleomenes and Dion, have\\r\\nBeen both at Delphos, and from thence have brought\\r\\nThe seal'd-up oracle, by the hand deliver'd\\r\\nOf great Apollo's priest; and that, since then,\\r\\nYou have not dared to break the holy seal\\r\\nNor read the secrets in't.\\r\\nCLEOMENES DION\\r\\nAll this we swear.\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nBreak up the seals and read.\\r\\nOfficer\\r\\n[Reads] Hermione is chaste;\\r\\nPolixenes blameless; Camillo a true subject; Leontes\\r\\na jealous tyrant; his innocent babe truly begotten;\\r\\nand the king shall live without an heir, if that\\r\\nwhich is lost be not found.\\r\\nLords\\r\\nNow blessed be the great Apollo!\\r\\nHERMIONE\\r\\nPraised!\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nHast thou read truth?\\r\\nOfficer\\r\\nAy, my lord; even so\\r\\nAs it is here set down.\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nThere is no truth at all i' the oracle:\\r\\nThe sessions shall proceed: this is mere falsehood.\\r\\nEnter Servant\\r\\n\\r\\nServant\\r\\nMy lord the king, the king!\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nWhat is the business?\\r\\nServant\\r\\nO sir, I shall be hated to report it!\\r\\nThe prince your son, with mere conceit and fear\\r\\nOf the queen's speed, is gone.\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nHow! gone!\\r\\nServant\\r\\nIs dead.\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nApollo's angry; and the heavens themselves\\r\\nDo strike at my injustice.\\r\\nHERMIONE swoons\\r\\n\\r\\nHow now there!\\r\\nPAULINA\\r\\nThis news is mortal to the queen: look down\\r\\nAnd see what death is doing.\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nTake her hence:\\r\\nHer heart is but o'ercharged; she will recover:\\r\\nI have too much believed mine own suspicion:\\r\\nBeseech you, tenderly apply to her\\r\\nSome remedies for life.\\r\\nExeunt PAULINA and Ladies, with HERMIONE\\r\\n\\r\\nApollo, pardon\\r\\nMy great profaneness 'gainst thine oracle!\\r\\nI'll reconcile me to Polixenes,\\r\\nNew woo my queen, recall the good Camillo,\\r\\nWhom I proclaim a man of truth, of mercy;\\r\\nFor, being transported by my jealousies\\r\\nTo bloody thoughts and to revenge, I chose\\r\\nCamillo for the minister to poison\\r\\nMy friend Polixenes: which had been done,\\r\\nBut that the good mind of Camillo tardied\\r\\nMy swift command, though I with death and with\\r\\nReward did threaten and encourage him,\\r\\nNot doing 't and being done: he, most humane\\r\\nAnd fill'd with honour, to my kingly guest\\r\\nUnclasp'd my practise, quit his fortunes here,\\r\\nWhich you knew great, and to the hazard\\r\\nOf all encertainties himself commended,\\r\\nNo richer than his honour: how he glisters\\r\\nThorough my rust! and how his pity\\r\\nDoes my deeds make the blacker!\\r\\nRe-enter PAULINA\\r\\n\\r\\nPAULINA\\r\\nWoe the while!\\r\\nO, cut my lace, lest my heart, cracking it,\\r\\nBreak too.\\r\\nFirst Lord\\r\\nWhat fit is this, good lady?\\r\\nPAULINA\\r\\nWhat studied torments, tyrant, hast for me?\\r\\nWhat wheels? racks? fires? what flaying? boiling?\\r\\nIn leads or oils? what old or newer torture\\r\\nMust I receive, whose every word deserves\\r\\nTo taste of thy most worst? Thy tyranny\\r\\nTogether working with thy jealousies,\\r\\nFancies too weak for boys, too green and idle\\r\\nFor girls of nine, O, think what they have done\\r\\nAnd then run mad indeed, stark mad! for all\\r\\nThy by-gone fooleries were but spices of it.\\r\\nThat thou betray'dst Polixenes,'twas nothing;\\r\\nThat did but show thee, of a fool, inconstant\\r\\nAnd damnable ingrateful: nor was't much,\\r\\nThou wouldst have poison'd good Camillo's honour,\\r\\nTo have him kill a king: poor trespasses,\\r\\nMore monstrous standing by: whereof I reckon\\r\\nThe casting forth to crows thy baby-daughter\\r\\nTo be or none or little; though a devil\\r\\nWould have shed water out of fire ere done't:\\r\\nNor is't directly laid to thee, the death\\r\\nOf the young prince, whose honourable thoughts,\\r\\nThoughts high for one so tender, cleft the heart\\r\\nThat could conceive a gross and foolish sire\\r\\nBlemish'd his gracious dam: this is not, no,\\r\\nLaid to thy answer: but the last,--O lords,\\r\\nWhen I have said, cry 'woe!' the queen, the queen,\\r\\nThe sweet'st, dear'st creature's dead,\\r\\nand vengeance for't\\r\\nNot dropp'd down yet.\\r\\nFirst Lord\\r\\nThe higher powers forbid!\\r\\nPAULINA\\r\\nI say she's dead; I'll swear't. If word nor oath\\r\\nPrevail not, go and see: if you can bring\\r\\nTincture or lustre in her lip, her eye,\\r\\nHeat outwardly or breath within, I'll serve you\\r\\nAs I would do the gods. But, O thou tyrant!\\r\\nDo not repent these things, for they are heavier\\r\\nThan all thy woes can stir; therefore betake thee\\r\\nTo nothing but despair. A thousand knees\\r\\nTen thousand years together, naked, fasting,\\r\\nUpon a barren mountain and still winter\\r\\nIn storm perpetual, could not move the gods\\r\\nTo look that way thou wert.\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nGo on, go on\\r\\nThou canst not speak too much; I have deserved\\r\\nAll tongues to talk their bitterest.\\r\\nFirst Lord\\r\\nSay no more:\\r\\nHowe'er the business goes, you have made fault\\r\\nI' the boldness of your speech.\\r\\nPAULINA\\r\\nI am sorry for't:\\r\\nAll faults I make, when I shall come to know them,\\r\\nI do repent. Alas! I have show'd too much\\r\\nThe rashness of a woman: he is touch'd\\r\\nTo the noble heart. What's gone and what's past help\\r\\nShould be past grief: do not receive affliction\\r\\nAt my petition; I beseech you, rather\\r\\nLet me be punish'd, that have minded you\\r\\nOf what you should forget. Now, good my liege\\r\\nSir, royal sir, forgive a foolish woman:\\r\\nThe love I bore your queen--lo, fool again!--\\r\\nI'll speak of her no more, nor of your children;\\r\\nI'll not remember you of my own lord,\\r\\nWho is lost too: take your patience to you,\\r\\nAnd I'll say nothing.\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nThou didst speak but well\\r\\nWhen most the truth; which I receive much better\\r\\nThan to be pitied of thee. Prithee, bring me\\r\\nTo the dead bodies of my queen and son:\\r\\nOne grave shall be for both: upon them shall\\r\\nThe causes of their death appear, unto\\r\\nOur shame perpetual. Once a day I'll visit\\r\\nThe chapel where they lie, and tears shed there\\r\\nShall be my recreation: so long as nature\\r\\nWill bear up with this exercise, so long\\r\\nI daily vow to use it. Come and lead me\\r\\nUnto these sorrows.\\r\\nExeunt\\r\\n\\r\\nSCENE III. Bohemia. A desert country near the sea.\\r\\nEnter ANTIGONUS with a Child, and a Mariner\\r\\nANTIGONUS\\r\\nThou art perfect then, our ship hath touch'd upon\\r\\nThe deserts of Bohemia?\\r\\nMariner\\r\\nAy, my lord: and fear\\r\\nWe have landed in ill time: the skies look grimly\\r\\nAnd threaten present blusters. In my conscience,\\r\\nThe heavens with that we have in hand are angry\\r\\nAnd frown upon 's.\\r\\nANTIGONUS\\r\\nTheir sacred wills be done! Go, get aboard;\\r\\nLook to thy bark: I'll not be long before\\r\\nI call upon thee.\\r\\nMariner\\r\\nMake your best haste, and go not\\r\\nToo far i' the land: 'tis like to be loud weather;\\r\\nBesides, this place is famous for the creatures\\r\\nOf prey that keep upon't.\\r\\nANTIGONUS\\r\\nGo thou away:\\r\\nI'll follow instantly.\\r\\nMariner\\r\\nI am glad at heart\\r\\nTo be so rid o' the business.\\r\\nExit\\r\\n\\r\\nANTIGONUS\\r\\nCome, poor babe:\\r\\nI have heard, but not believed,\\r\\nthe spirits o' the dead\\r\\nMay walk again: if such thing be, thy mother\\r\\nAppear'd to me last night, for ne'er was dream\\r\\nSo like a waking. To me comes a creature,\\r\\nSometimes her head on one side, some another;\\r\\nI never saw a vessel of like sorrow,\\r\\nSo fill'd and so becoming: in pure white robes,\\r\\nLike very sanctity, she did approach\\r\\nMy cabin where I lay; thrice bow'd before me,\\r\\nAnd gasping to begin some speech, her eyes\\r\\nBecame two spouts: the fury spent, anon\\r\\nDid this break-from her: 'Good Antigonus,\\r\\nSince fate, against thy better disposition,\\r\\nHath made thy person for the thrower-out\\r\\nOf my poor babe, according to thine oath,\\r\\nPlaces remote enough are in Bohemia,\\r\\nThere weep and leave it crying; and, for the babe\\r\\nIs counted lost for ever, Perdita,\\r\\nI prithee, call't. For this ungentle business\\r\\nPut on thee by my lord, thou ne'er shalt see\\r\\nThy wife Paulina more.' And so, with shrieks\\r\\nShe melted into air. Affrighted much,\\r\\nI did in time collect myself and thought\\r\\nThis was so and no slumber. Dreams are toys:\\r\\nYet for this once, yea, superstitiously,\\r\\nI will be squared by this. I do believe\\r\\nHermione hath suffer'd death, and that\\r\\nApollo would, this being indeed the issue\\r\\nOf King Polixenes, it should here be laid,\\r\\nEither for life or death, upon the earth\\r\\nOf its right father. Blossom, speed thee well!\\r\\nThere lie, and there thy character: there these;\\r\\nWhich may, if fortune please, both breed thee, pretty,\\r\\nAnd still rest thine. The storm begins; poor wretch,\\r\\nThat for thy mother's fault art thus exposed\\r\\nTo loss and what may follow! Weep I cannot,\\r\\nBut my heart bleeds; and most accursed am I\\r\\nTo be by oath enjoin'd to this. Farewell!\\r\\nThe day frowns more and more: thou'rt like to have\\r\\nA lullaby too rough: I never saw\\r\\nThe heavens so dim by day. A savage clamour!\\r\\nWell may I get aboard! This is the chase:\\r\\nI am gone for ever.\\r\\nExit, pursued by a bear\\r\\n\\r\\nEnter a Shepherd\\r\\n\\r\\nShepherd\\r\\nI would there were no age between sixteen and\\r\\nthree-and-twenty, or that youth would sleep out the\\r\\nrest; for there is nothing in the between but\\r\\ngetting wenches with child, wronging the ancientry,\\r\\nstealing, fighting--Hark you now! Would any but\\r\\nthese boiled brains of nineteen and two-and-twenty\\r\\nhunt this weather? They have scared away two of my\\r\\nbest sheep, which I fear the wolf will sooner find\\r\\nthan the master: if any where I have them, 'tis by\\r\\nthe seaside, browsing of ivy. Good luck, an't be thy\\r\\nwill what have we here! Mercy on 's, a barne a very\\r\\npretty barne! A boy or a child, I wonder? A\\r\\npretty one; a very pretty one: sure, some 'scape:\\r\\nthough I am not bookish, yet I can read\\r\\nwaiting-gentlewoman in the 'scape. This has been\\r\\nsome stair-work, some trunk-work, some\\r\\nbehind-door-work: they were warmer that got this\\r\\nthan the poor thing is here. I'll take it up for\\r\\npity: yet I'll tarry till my son come; he hallooed\\r\\nbut even now. Whoa, ho, hoa!\\r\\nEnter Clown\\r\\n\\r\\nClown\\r\\nHilloa, loa!\\r\\nShepherd\\r\\nWhat, art so near? If thou'lt see a thing to talk\\r\\non when thou art dead and rotten, come hither. What\\r\\nailest thou, man?\\r\\nClown\\r\\nI have seen two such sights, by sea and by land!\\r\\nbut I am not to say it is a sea, for it is now the\\r\\nsky: betwixt the firmament and it you cannot thrust\\r\\na bodkin's point.\\r\\nShepherd\\r\\nWhy, boy, how is it?\\r\\nClown\\r\\nI would you did but see how it chafes, how it rages,\\r\\nhow it takes up the shore! but that's not the\\r\\npoint. O, the most piteous cry of the poor souls!\\r\\nsometimes to see 'em, and not to see 'em; now the\\r\\nship boring the moon with her main-mast, and anon\\r\\nswallowed with yest and froth, as you'ld thrust a\\r\\ncork into a hogshead. And then for the\\r\\nland-service, to see how the bear tore out his\\r\\nshoulder-bone; how he cried to me for help and said\\r\\nhis name was Antigonus, a nobleman. But to make an\\r\\nend of the ship, to see how the sea flap-dragoned\\r\\nit: but, first, how the poor souls roared, and the\\r\\nsea mocked them; and how the poor gentleman roared\\r\\nand the bear mocked him, both roaring louder than\\r\\nthe sea or weather.\\r\\nShepherd\\r\\nName of mercy, when was this, boy?\\r\\nClown\\r\\nNow, now: I have not winked since I saw these\\r\\nsights: the men are not yet cold under water, nor\\r\\nthe bear half dined on the gentleman: he's at it\\r\\nnow.\\r\\nShepherd\\r\\nWould I had been by, to have helped the old man!\\r\\nClown\\r\\nI would you had been by the ship side, to have\\r\\nhelped her: there your charity would have lacked footing.\\r\\nShepherd\\r\\nHeavy matters! heavy matters! but look thee here,\\r\\nboy. Now bless thyself: thou mettest with things\\r\\ndying, I with things newborn. Here's a sight for\\r\\nthee; look thee, a bearing-cloth for a squire's\\r\\nchild! look thee here; take up, take up, boy;\\r\\nopen't. So, let's see: it was told me I should be\\r\\nrich by the fairies. This is some changeling:\\r\\nopen't. What's within, boy?\\r\\nClown\\r\\nYou're a made old man: if the sins of your youth\\r\\nare forgiven you, you're well to live. Gold! all gold!\\r\\nShepherd\\r\\nThis is fairy gold, boy, and 'twill prove so: up\\r\\nwith't, keep it close: home, home, the next way.\\r\\nWe are lucky, boy; and to be so still requires\\r\\nnothing but secrecy. Let my sheep go: come, good\\r\\nboy, the next way home.\\r\\nClown\\r\\nGo you the next way with your findings. I'll go see\\r\\nif the bear be gone from the gentleman and how much\\r\\nhe hath eaten: they are never curst but when they\\r\\nare hungry: if there be any of him left, I'll bury\\r\\nit.\\r\\nShepherd\\r\\nThat's a good deed. If thou mayest discern by that\\r\\nwhich is left of him what he is, fetch me to the\\r\\nsight of him.\\r\\nClown\\r\\nMarry, will I; and you shall help to put him i' the ground.\\r\\nShepherd\\r\\n'Tis a lucky day, boy, and we'll do good deeds on't.\\r\\nExeunt\\r\\n\\r\\nACT IV\\r\\nSCENE I:\\r\\nEnter Time, the Chorus\\r\\n\\r\\nTime\\r\\nI, that please some, try all, both joy and terror\\r\\nOf good and bad, that makes and unfolds error,\\r\\nNow take upon me, in the name of Time,\\r\\nTo use my wings. Impute it not a crime\\r\\nTo me or my swift passage, that I slide\\r\\nO'er sixteen years and leave the growth untried\\r\\nOf that wide gap, since it is in my power\\r\\nTo o'erthrow law and in one self-born hour\\r\\nTo plant and o'erwhelm custom. Let me pass\\r\\nThe same I am, ere ancient'st order was\\r\\nOr what is now received: I witness to\\r\\nThe times that brought them in; so shall I do\\r\\nTo the freshest things now reigning and make stale\\r\\nThe glistering of this present, as my tale\\r\\nNow seems to it. Your patience this allowing,\\r\\nI turn my glass and give my scene such growing\\r\\nAs you had slept between: Leontes leaving,\\r\\nThe effects of his fond jealousies so grieving\\r\\nThat he shuts up himself, imagine me,\\r\\nGentle spectators, that I now may be\\r\\nIn fair Bohemia, and remember well,\\r\\nI mentioned a son o' the king's, which Florizel\\r\\nI now name to you; and with speed so pace\\r\\nTo speak of Perdita, now grown in grace\\r\\nEqual with wondering: what of her ensues\\r\\nI list not prophecy; but let Time's news\\r\\nBe known when 'tis brought forth.\\r\\nA shepherd's daughter,\\r\\nAnd what to her adheres, which follows after,\\r\\nIs the argument of Time. Of this allow,\\r\\nIf ever you have spent time worse ere now;\\r\\nIf never, yet that Time himself doth say\\r\\nHe wishes earnestly you never may.\\r\\nExit\\r\\n\\r\\nSCENE II. Bohemia. The palace of POLIXENES.\\r\\nEnter POLIXENES and CAMILLO\\r\\nPOLIXENES\\r\\nI pray thee, good Camillo, be no more importunate:\\r\\n'tis a sickness denying thee any thing; a death to\\r\\ngrant this.\\r\\nCAMILLO\\r\\nIt is fifteen years since I saw my country: though\\r\\nI have for the most part been aired abroad, I\\r\\ndesire to lay my bones there. Besides, the penitent\\r\\nking, my master, hath sent for me; to whose feeling\\r\\nsorrows I might be some allay, or I o'erween to\\r\\nthink so, which is another spur to my departure.\\r\\nPOLIXENES\\r\\nAs thou lovest me, Camillo, wipe not out the rest of\\r\\nthy services by leaving me now: the need I have of\\r\\nthee thine own goodness hath made; better not to\\r\\nhave had thee than thus to want thee: thou, having\\r\\nmade me businesses which none without thee can\\r\\nsufficiently manage, must either stay to execute\\r\\nthem thyself or take away with thee the very\\r\\nservices thou hast done; which if I have not enough\\r\\nconsidered, as too much I cannot, to be more\\r\\nthankful to thee shall be my study, and my profit\\r\\ntherein the heaping friendships. Of that fatal\\r\\ncountry, Sicilia, prithee speak no more; whose very\\r\\nnaming punishes me with the remembrance of that\\r\\npenitent, as thou callest him, and reconciled king,\\r\\nmy brother; whose loss of his most precious queen\\r\\nand children are even now to be afresh lamented.\\r\\nSay to me, when sawest thou the Prince Florizel, my\\r\\nson? Kings are no less unhappy, their issue not\\r\\nbeing gracious, than they are in losing them when\\r\\nthey have approved their virtues.\\r\\nCAMILLO\\r\\nSir, it is three days since I saw the prince. What\\r\\nhis happier affairs may be, are to me unknown: but I\\r\\nhave missingly noted, he is of late much retired\\r\\nfrom court and is less frequent to his princely\\r\\nexercises than formerly he hath appeared.\\r\\nPOLIXENES\\r\\nI have considered so much, Camillo, and with some\\r\\ncare; so far that I have eyes under my service which\\r\\nlook upon his removedness; from whom I have this\\r\\nintelligence, that he is seldom from the house of a\\r\\nmost homely shepherd; a man, they say, that from\\r\\nvery nothing, and beyond the imagination of his\\r\\nneighbours, is grown into an unspeakable estate.\\r\\nCAMILLO\\r\\nI have heard, sir, of such a man, who hath a\\r\\ndaughter of most rare note: the report of her is\\r\\nextended more than can be thought to begin from such a cottage.\\r\\nPOLIXENES\\r\\nThat's likewise part of my intelligence; but, I\\r\\nfear, the angle that plucks our son thither. Thou\\r\\nshalt accompany us to the place; where we will, not\\r\\nappearing what we are, have some question with the\\r\\nshepherd; from whose simplicity I think it not\\r\\nuneasy to get the cause of my son's resort thither.\\r\\nPrithee, be my present partner in this business, and\\r\\nlay aside the thoughts of Sicilia.\\r\\nCAMILLO\\r\\nI willingly obey your command.\\r\\nPOLIXENES\\r\\nMy best Camillo! We must disguise ourselves.\\r\\nExeunt\\r\\n\\r\\nSCENE III. A road near the Shepherd's cottage.\\r\\nEnter AUTOLYCUS, singing\\r\\nAUTOLYCUS\\r\\nWhen daffodils begin to peer,\\r\\nWith heigh! the doxy over the dale,\\r\\nWhy, then comes in the sweet o' the year;\\r\\nFor the red blood reigns in the winter's pale.\\r\\nThe white sheet bleaching on the hedge,\\r\\nWith heigh! the sweet birds, O, how they sing!\\r\\nDoth set my pugging tooth on edge;\\r\\nFor a quart of ale is a dish for a king.\\r\\nThe lark, that tirra-lyra chants,\\r\\nWith heigh! with heigh! the thrush and the jay,\\r\\nAre summer songs for me and my aunts,\\r\\nWhile we lie tumbling in the hay.\\r\\nI have served Prince Florizel and in my time\\r\\nwore three-pile; but now I am out of service:\\r\\nBut shall I go mourn for that, my dear?\\r\\nThe pale moon shines by night:\\r\\nAnd when I wander here and there,\\r\\nI then do most go right.\\r\\nIf tinkers may have leave to live,\\r\\nAnd bear the sow-skin budget,\\r\\nThen my account I well may, give,\\r\\nAnd in the stocks avouch it.\\r\\nMy traffic is sheets; when the kite builds, look to\\r\\nlesser linen. My father named me Autolycus; who\\r\\nbeing, as I am, littered under Mercury, was likewise\\r\\na snapper-up of unconsidered trifles. With die and\\r\\ndrab I purchased this caparison, and my revenue is\\r\\nthe silly cheat.

But my father\\r\\nhath made her mistress of the feast, and she lays it\\r\\non. She hath made me four and twenty nose-gays for\\r\\nthe shearers, three-man-song-men all, and very good\\r\\nones; but they are most of them means and bases; but\\r\\none puritan amongst them, and he sings psalms to\\r\\nhorn-pipes. I must have saffron to colour the warden\\r\\npies; mace; dates?--none, that's out of my note;\\r\\nnutmegs, seven; a race or two of ginger, but that I\\r\\nmay beg; four pound of prunes, and as many of\\r\\nraisins o' the sun.\\r\\nAUTOLYCUS\\r\\nO that ever I was born!\\r\\nGrovelling on the ground\\r\\n\\r\\nClown\\r\\nI' the name of me--\\r\\nAUTOLYCUS\\r\\nO, help me, help me! pluck but off these rags; and\\r\\nthen, death, death!\\r\\nClown\\r\\nAlack, poor soul! thou hast need of more rags to lay\\r\\non thee, rather than have these off.\\r\\nAUTOLYCUS\\r\\nO sir, the loathsomeness of them offends me more\\r\\nthan the stripes I have received, which are mighty\\r\\nones and millions.\\r\\nClown\\r\\nAlas, poor man! a million of beating may come to a\\r\\ngreat matter.\\r\\nAUTOLYCUS\\r\\nI am robbed, sir, and beaten; my money and apparel\\r\\nta'en from me, and these detestable things put upon\\r\\nme.\\r\\nClown\\r\\nWhat, by a horseman, or a footman?\\r\\nAUTOLYCUS\\r\\nA footman, sweet sir, a footman.\\r\\nClown\\r\\nIndeed, he should be a footman by the garments he\\r\\nhas left with thee: if this be a horseman's coat,\\r\\nit hath seen very hot service.

Your high self,\\r\\nThe gracious mark o' the land, you have obscured\\r\\nWith a swain's wearing, and me, poor lowly maid,\\r\\nMost goddess-like prank'd up: but that our feasts\\r\\nIn every mess have folly and the feeders\\r\\nDigest it with a custom, I should blush\\r\\nTo see you so attired, sworn, I think,\\r\\nTo show myself a glass.\\r\\nFLORIZEL\\r\\nI bless the time\\r\\nWhen my good falcon made her flight across\\r\\nThy father's ground.\\r\\nPERDITA\\r\\nNow Jove afford you cause!\\r\\nTo me the difference forges dread; your greatness\\r\\nHath not been used to fear.

What would he say? Or how\\r\\nShould I, in these my borrow'd flaunts, behold\\r\\nThe sternness of his presence?\\r\\nFLORIZEL\\r\\nApprehend\\r\\nNothing but jollity.

'tis well they are whispering: clamour\\r\\nyour tongues, and not a word more.\\r\\nMOPSA\\r\\nI have done.

O, hear me breathe my life\\r\\nBefore this ancient sir, who, it should seem,\\r\\nHath sometime loved! I take thy hand, this hand,\\r\\nAs soft as dove's down and as white as it,\\r\\nOr Ethiopian's tooth, or the fann'd\\r\\nsnow that's bolted\\r\\nBy the northern blasts twice o'er.\\r\\nPOLIXENES\\r\\nWhat follows this?\\r\\nHow prettily the young swain seems to wash\\r\\nThe hand was fair before! I have put you out:\\r\\nBut to your protestation; let me hear\\r\\nWhat you profess.\\r\\nFLORIZEL\\r\\nDo, and be witness to 't.\\r\\nPOLIXENES\\r\\nAnd this my neighbour too?\\r\\nFLORIZEL\\r\\nAnd he, and more\\r\\nThan he, and men, the earth, the heavens, and all:\\r\\nThat, were I crown'd the most imperial monarch,\\r\\nThereof most worthy, were I the fairest youth\\r\\nThat ever made eye swerve, had force and knowledge\\r\\nMore than was ever man's, I would not prize them\\r\\nWithout her love; for her employ them all;\\r\\nCommend them and condemn them to her service\\r\\nOr to their own perdition.\\r\\nPOLIXENES\\r\\nFairly offer'd.\\r\\nCAMILLO\\r\\nThis shows a sound affection.\\r\\nShepherd\\r\\nBut, my daughter,\\r\\nSay you the like to him?\\r\\nPERDITA\\r\\nI cannot speak\\r\\nSo well, nothing so well; no, nor mean better:\\r\\nBy the pattern of mine own thoughts I cut out\\r\\nThe purity of his.\\r\\nShepherd\\r\\nTake hands, a bargain!\\r\\nAnd, friends unknown, you shall bear witness to 't:\\r\\nI give my daughter to him, and will make\\r\\nHer portion equal his.\\r\\nFLORIZEL\\r\\nO, that must be\\r\\nI' the virtue of your daughter: one being dead,\\r\\nI shall have more than you can dream of yet;\\r\\nEnough then for your wonder. But, come on,\\r\\nContract us 'fore these witnesses.\\r\\nShepherd\\r\\nCome, your hand;\\r\\nAnd, daughter, yours.\\r\\nPOLIXENES\\r\\nSoft, swain, awhile, beseech you;\\r\\nHave you a father?\\r\\nFLORIZEL\\r\\nI have: but what of him?\\r\\nPOLIXENES\\r\\nKnows he of this?\\r\\nFLORIZEL\\r\\nHe neither does nor shall.\\r\\nPOLIXENES\\r\\nMethinks a father\\r\\nIs at the nuptial of his son a guest\\r\\nThat best becomes the table. Pray you once more,\\r\\nIs not your father grown incapable\\r\\nOf reasonable affairs? is he not stupid\\r\\nWith age and altering rheums? can he speak? hear?\\r\\nKnow man from man? dispute his own estate?\\r\\nLies he not bed-rid? and again does nothing\\r\\nBut what he did being childish?\\r\\nFLORIZEL\\r\\nNo, good sir;\\r\\nHe has his health and ampler strength indeed\\r\\nThan most have of his age.\\r\\nPOLIXENES\\r\\nBy my white beard,\\r\\nYou offer him, if this be so, a wrong\\r\\nSomething unfilial: reason my son\\r\\nShould choose himself a wife, but as good reason\\r\\nThe father, all whose joy is nothing else\\r\\nBut fair posterity, should hold some counsel\\r\\nIn such a business.\\r\\nFLORIZEL\\r\\nI yield all this;\\r\\nBut for some other reasons, my grave sir,\\r\\nWhich 'tis not fit you know, I not acquaint\\r\\nMy father of this business.\\r\\nPOLIXENES\\r\\nLet him know't.\\r\\nFLORIZEL\\r\\nHe shall not.\\r\\nPOLIXENES\\r\\nPrithee, let him.\\r\\nFLORIZEL\\r\\nNo, he must not.\\r\\nShepherd\\r\\nLet him, my son: he shall not need to grieve\\r\\nAt knowing of thy choice.\\r\\nFLORIZEL\\r\\nCome, come, he must not.\\r\\nMark our contract.\\r\\nPOLIXENES\\r\\nMark your divorce, young sir,\\r\\nDiscovering himself\\r\\n\\r\\nWhom son I dare not call; thou art too base\\r\\nTo be acknowledged: thou a sceptre's heir,\\r\\nThat thus affect'st a sheep-hook! Thou old traitor,\\r\\nI am sorry that by hanging thee I can\\r\\nBut shorten thy life one week. And thou, fresh piece\\r\\nOf excellent witchcraft, who of force must know\\r\\nThe royal fool thou copest with,--\\r\\nShepherd\\r\\nO, my heart!\\r\\nPOLIXENES\\r\\nI'll have thy beauty scratch'd with briers, and made\\r\\nMore homely than thy state. For thee, fond boy,\\r\\nIf I may ever know thou dost but sigh\\r\\nThat thou no more shalt see this knack, as never\\r\\nI mean thou shalt, we'll bar thee from succession;\\r\\nNot hold thee of our blood, no, not our kin,\\r\\nFar than Deucalion off: mark thou my words:\\r\\nFollow us to the court. Thou churl, for this time,\\r\\nThough full of our displeasure, yet we free thee\\r\\nFrom the dead blow of it. And you, enchantment.--\\r\\nWorthy enough a herdsman: yea, him too,\\r\\nThat makes himself, but for our honour therein,\\r\\nUnworthy thee,--if ever henceforth thou\\r\\nThese rural latches to his entrance open,\\r\\nOr hoop his body more with thy embraces,\\r\\nI will devise a death as cruel for thee\\r\\nAs thou art tender to't.\\r\\nExit\\r\\n\\r\\nPERDITA\\r\\nEven here undone!\\r\\nI was not much afeard; for once or twice\\r\\nI was about to speak and tell him plainly,\\r\\nThe selfsame sun that shines upon his court\\r\\nHides not his visage from our cottage but\\r\\nLooks on alike. Will't please you, sir, be gone?\\r\\nI told you what would come of this: beseech you,\\r\\nOf your own state take care: this dream of mine,--\\r\\nBeing now awake, I'll queen it no inch farther,\\r\\nBut milk my ewes and weep.\\r\\nCAMILLO\\r\\nWhy, how now, father!\\r\\nSpeak ere thou diest.\\r\\nShepherd\\r\\nI cannot speak, nor think\\r\\nNor dare to know that which I know. O sir!\\r\\nYou have undone a man of fourscore three,\\r\\nThat thought to fill his grave in quiet, yea,\\r\\nTo die upon the bed my father died,\\r\\nTo lie close by his honest bones: but now\\r\\nSome hangman must put on my shroud and lay me\\r\\nWhere no priest shovels in dust. O cursed wretch,\\r\\nThat knew'st this was the prince,\\r\\nand wouldst adventure\\r\\nTo mingle faith with him! Undone! undone!\\r\\nIf I might die within this hour, I have lived\\r\\nTo die when I desire.\\r\\nExit\\r\\n\\r\\nFLORIZEL\\r\\nWhy look you so upon me?\\r\\nI am but sorry, not afeard; delay'd,\\r\\nBut nothing alter'd: what I was, I am;\\r\\nMore straining on for plucking back, not following\\r\\nMy leash unwillingly.\\r\\nCAMILLO\\r\\nGracious my lord,\\r\\nYou know your father's temper: at this time\\r\\nHe will allow no speech, which I do guess\\r\\nYou do not purpose to him; and as hardly\\r\\nWill he endure your sight as yet, I fear:\\r\\nThen, till the fury of his highness settle,\\r\\nCome not before him.\\r\\nFLORIZEL\\r\\nI not purpose it.\\r\\nI think, Camillo?\\r\\nCAMILLO\\r\\nEven he, my lord.\\r\\nPERDITA\\r\\nHow often have I told you 'twould be thus!\\r\\nHow often said, my dignity would last\\r\\nBut till 'twere known!\\r\\nFLORIZEL\\r\\nIt cannot fail but by\\r\\nThe violation of my faith; and then\\r\\nLet nature crush the sides o' the earth together\\r\\nAnd mar the seeds within! Lift up thy looks:\\r\\nFrom my succession wipe me, father; I\\r\\nAm heir to my affection.\\r\\nCAMILLO\\r\\nBe advised.\\r\\nFLORIZEL\\r\\nI am, and by my fancy: if my reason\\r\\nWill thereto be obedient, I have reason;\\r\\nIf not, my senses, better pleased with madness,\\r\\nDo bid it welcome.\\r\\nCAMILLO\\r\\nThis is desperate, sir.\\r\\nFLORIZEL\\r\\nSo call it: but it does fulfil my vow;\\r\\nI needs must think it honesty. Camillo,\\r\\nNot for Bohemia, nor the pomp that may\\r\\nBe thereat glean'd, for all the sun sees or\\r\\nThe close earth wombs or the profound sea hides\\r\\nIn unknown fathoms, will I break my oath\\r\\nTo this my fair beloved: therefore, I pray you,\\r\\nAs you have ever been my father's honour'd friend,\\r\\nWhen he shall miss me,--as, in faith, I mean not\\r\\nTo see him any more,--cast your good counsels\\r\\nUpon his passion; let myself and fortune\\r\\nTug for the time to come. This you may know\\r\\nAnd so deliver, I am put to sea\\r\\nWith her whom here I cannot hold on shore;\\r\\nAnd most opportune to our need I have\\r\\nA vessel rides fast by, but not prepared\\r\\nFor this design. What course I mean to hold\\r\\nShall nothing benefit your knowledge, nor\\r\\nConcern me the reporting.\\r\\nCAMILLO\\r\\nO my lord!\\r\\nI would your spirit were easier for advice,\\r\\nOr stronger for your need.\\r\\nFLORIZEL\\r\\nHark, Perdita\\r\\nDrawing her aside\\r\\n\\r\\nI'll hear you by and by.\\r\\nCAMILLO\\r\\nHe's irremoveable,\\r\\nResolved for flight. Now were I happy, if\\r\\nHis going I could frame to serve my turn,\\r\\nSave him from danger, do him love and honour,\\r\\nPurchase the sight again of dear Sicilia\\r\\nAnd that unhappy king, my master, whom\\r\\nI so much thirst to see.\\r\\nFLORIZEL\\r\\nNow, good Camillo;\\r\\nI am so fraught with curious business that\\r\\nI leave out ceremony.\\r\\nCAMILLO\\r\\nSir, I think\\r\\nYou have heard of my poor services, i' the love\\r\\nThat I have borne your father?\\r\\nFLORIZEL\\r\\nVery nobly\\r\\nHave you deserved: it is my father's music\\r\\nTo speak your deeds, not little of his care\\r\\nTo have them recompensed as thought on.\\r\\nCAMILLO\\r\\nWell, my lord,\\r\\nIf you may please to think I love the king\\r\\nAnd through him what is nearest to him, which is\\r\\nYour gracious self, embrace but my direction:\\r\\nIf your more ponderous and settled project\\r\\nMay suffer alteration, on mine honour,\\r\\nI'll point you where you shall have such receiving\\r\\nAs shall become your highness; where you may\\r\\nEnjoy your mistress, from the whom, I see,\\r\\nThere's no disjunction to be made, but by--\\r\\nAs heavens forefend!--your ruin; marry her,\\r\\nAnd, with my best endeavours in your absence,\\r\\nYour discontenting father strive to qualify\\r\\nAnd bring him up to liking.\\r\\nFLORIZEL\\r\\nHow, Camillo,\\r\\nMay this, almost a miracle, be done?\\r\\nThat I may call thee something more than man\\r\\nAnd after that trust to thee.\\r\\nCAMILLO\\r\\nHave you thought on\\r\\nA place whereto you'll go?\\r\\nFLORIZEL\\r\\nNot any yet:\\r\\nBut as the unthought-on accident is guilty\\r\\nTo what we wildly do, so we profess\\r\\nOurselves to be the slaves of chance and flies\\r\\nOf every wind that blows.\\r\\nCAMILLO\\r\\nThen list to me:\\r\\nThis follows, if you will not change your purpose\\r\\nBut undergo this flight, make for Sicilia,\\r\\nAnd there present yourself and your fair princess,\\r\\nFor so I see she must be, 'fore Leontes:\\r\\nShe shall be habited as it becomes\\r\\nThe partner of your bed. Methinks I see\\r\\nLeontes opening his free arms and weeping\\r\\nHis welcomes forth; asks thee the son forgiveness,\\r\\nAs 'twere i' the father's person; kisses the hands\\r\\nOf your fresh princess; o'er and o'er divides him\\r\\n'Twixt his unkindness and his kindness; the one\\r\\nHe chides to hell and bids the other grow\\r\\nFaster than thought or time.\\r\\nFLORIZEL\\r\\nWorthy Camillo,\\r\\nWhat colour for my visitation shall I\\r\\nHold up before him?\\r\\nCAMILLO\\r\\nSent by the king your father\\r\\nTo greet him and to give him comforts. Sir,\\r\\nThe manner of your bearing towards him, with\\r\\nWhat you as from your father shall deliver,\\r\\nThings known betwixt us three, I'll write you down:\\r\\nThe which shall point you forth at every sitting\\r\\nWhat you must say; that he shall not perceive\\r\\nBut that you have your father's bosom there\\r\\nAnd speak his very heart.\\r\\nFLORIZEL\\r\\nI am bound to you:\\r\\nThere is some sap in this.\\r\\nCAMILLO\\r\\nA cause more promising\\r\\nThan a wild dedication of yourselves\\r\\nTo unpath'd waters, undream'd shores, most certain\\r\\nTo miseries enough; no hope to help you,\\r\\nBut as you shake off one to take another;\\r\\nNothing so certain as your anchors, who\\r\\nDo their best office, if they can but stay you\\r\\nWhere you'll be loath to be: besides you know\\r\\nProsperity's the very bond of love,\\r\\nWhose fresh complexion and whose heart together\\r\\nAffliction alters.\\r\\nPERDITA\\r\\nOne of these is true:\\r\\nI think affliction may subdue the cheek,\\r\\nBut not take in the mind.\\r\\nCAMILLO\\r\\nYea, say you so?\\r\\nThere shall not at your father's house these\\r\\nseven years\\r\\nBe born another such.\\r\\nFLORIZEL\\r\\nMy good Camillo,\\r\\nShe is as forward of her breeding as\\r\\nShe is i' the rear our birth.\\r\\nCAMILLO\\r\\nI cannot say 'tis pity\\r\\nShe lacks instructions, for she seems a mistress\\r\\nTo most that teach.\\r\\nPERDITA\\r\\nYour pardon, sir; for this\\r\\nI'll blush you thanks.\\r\\nFLORIZEL\\r\\nMy prettiest Perdita!\\r\\nBut O, the thorns we stand upon! Camillo,\\r\\nPreserver of my father, now of me,\\r\\nThe medicine of our house, how shall we do?\\r\\nWe are not furnish'd like Bohemia's son,\\r\\nNor shall appear in Sicilia.\\r\\nCAMILLO\\r\\nMy lord,\\r\\nFear none of this: I think you know my fortunes\\r\\nDo all lie there: it shall be so my care\\r\\nTo have you royally appointed as if\\r\\nThe scene you play were mine. For instance, sir,\\r\\nThat you may know you shall not want, one word.\\r\\nThey talk aside\\r\\n\\r\\nRe-enter AUTOLYCUS\\r\\n\\r\\nAUTOLYCUS\\r\\nHa, ha! what a fool Honesty is! and Trust, his\\r\\nsworn brother, a very simple gentleman! I have sold\\r\\nall my trumpery; not a counterfeit stone, not a\\r\\nribbon, glass, pomander, brooch, table-book, ballad,\\r\\nknife, tape, glove, shoe-tie, bracelet, horn-ring,\\r\\nto keep my pack from fasting: they throng who\\r\\nshould buy first, as if my trinkets had been\\r\\nhallowed and brought a benediction to the buyer:\\r\\nby which means I saw whose purse was best in\\r\\npicture; and what I saw, to my good use I\\r\\nremembered. My clown, who wants but something to\\r\\nbe a reasonable man, grew so in love with the\\r\\nwenches' song, that he would not stir his pettitoes\\r\\ntill he had both tune and words; which so drew the\\r\\nrest of the herd to me that all their other senses\\r\\nstuck in ears: you might have pinched a placket, it\\r\\nwas senseless; 'twas nothing to geld a codpiece of a\\r\\npurse; I could have filed keys off that hung in\\r\\nchains: no hearing, no feeling, but my sir's song,\\r\\nand admiring the nothing of it. So that in this\\r\\ntime of lethargy I picked and cut most of their\\r\\nfestival purses; and had not the old man come in\\r\\nwith a whoo-bub against his daughter and the king's\\r\\nson and scared my choughs from the chaff, I had not\\r\\nleft a purse alive in the whole army.\\r\\nCAMILLO, FLORIZEL, and PERDITA come forward\\r\\n\\r\\nCAMILLO\\r\\nNay, but my letters, by this means being there\\r\\nSo soon as you arrive, shall clear that doubt.\\r\\nFLORIZEL\\r\\nAnd those that you'll procure from King Leontes--\\r\\nCAMILLO\\r\\nShall satisfy your father.\\r\\nPERDITA\\r\\nHappy be you!\\r\\nAll that you speak shows fair.\\r\\nCAMILLO\\r\\nWho have we here?\\r\\nSeeing AUTOLYCUS\\r\\n\\r\\nWe'll make an instrument of this, omit\\r\\nNothing may give us aid.\\r\\nAUTOLYCUS\\r\\nIf they have overheard me now, why, hanging.\\r\\nCAMILLO\\r\\nHow now, good fellow! why shakest thou so? Fear\\r\\nnot, man; here's no harm intended to thee.\\r\\nAUTOLYCUS\\r\\nI am a poor fellow, sir.\\r\\nCAMILLO\\r\\nWhy, be so still; here's nobody will steal that from\\r\\nthee: yet for the outside of thy poverty we must\\r\\nmake an exchange; therefore discase thee instantly,\\r\\n--thou must think there's a necessity in't,--and\\r\\nchange garments with this gentleman: though the\\r\\npennyworth on his side be the worst, yet hold thee,\\r\\nthere's some boot.\\r\\nAUTOLYCUS\\r\\nI am a poor fellow, sir.\\r\\nAside\\r\\n\\r\\nI know ye well enough.\\r\\nCAMILLO\\r\\nNay, prithee, dispatch: the gentleman is half\\r\\nflayed already.\\r\\nAUTOLYCUS\\r\\nAre you in earnest, sir?\\r\\nAside\\r\\n\\r\\nI smell the trick on't.\\r\\nFLORIZEL\\r\\nDispatch, I prithee.\\r\\nAUTOLYCUS\\r\\nIndeed, I have had earnest: but I cannot with\\r\\nconscience take it.\\r\\nCAMILLO\\r\\nUnbuckle, unbuckle.\\r\\nFLORIZEL and AUTOLYCUS exchange garments\\r\\n\\r\\nFortunate mistress,--let my prophecy\\r\\nCome home to ye!--you must retire yourself\\r\\nInto some covert: take your sweetheart's hat\\r\\nAnd pluck it o'er your brows, muffle your face,\\r\\nDismantle you, and, as you can, disliken\\r\\nThe truth of your own seeming; that you may--\\r\\nFor I do fear eyes over--to shipboard\\r\\nGet undescried.\\r\\nPERDITA\\r\\nI see the play so lies\\r\\nThat I must bear a part.\\r\\nCAMILLO\\r\\nNo remedy.\\r\\nHave you done there?\\r\\nFLORIZEL\\r\\nShould I now meet my father,\\r\\nHe would not call me son.\\r\\nCAMILLO\\r\\nNay, you shall have no hat.\\r\\nGiving it to PERDITA\\r\\n\\r\\nCome, lady, come. Farewell, my friend.\\r\\nAUTOLYCUS\\r\\nAdieu, sir.\\r\\nFLORIZEL\\r\\nO Perdita, what have we twain forgot!\\r\\nPray you, a word.\\r\\nCAMILLO\\r\\n[Aside] What I do next, shall be to tell the king\\r\\nOf this escape and whither they are bound;\\r\\nWherein my hope is I shall so prevail\\r\\nTo force him after: in whose company\\r\\nI shall review Sicilia, for whose sight\\r\\nI have a woman's longing.\\r\\nFLORIZEL\\r\\nFortune speed us!\\r\\nThus we set on, Camillo, to the sea-side.\\r\\nCAMILLO\\r\\nThe swifter speed the better.\\r\\nExeunt FLORIZEL, PERDITA, and CAMILLO\\r\\n\\r\\nAUTOLYCUS\\r\\nI understand the business, I hear it: to have an\\r\\nopen ear, a quick eye, and a nimble hand, is\\r\\nnecessary for a cut-purse; a good nose is requisite\\r\\nalso, to smell out work for the other senses. I see\\r\\nthis is the time that the unjust man doth thrive.\\r\\nWhat an exchange had this been without boot! What\\r\\na boot is here with this exchange! Sure the gods do\\r\\nthis year connive at us, and we may do any thing\\r\\nextempore. The prince himself is about a piece of\\r\\niniquity, stealing away from his father with his\\r\\nclog at his heels: if I thought it were a piece of\\r\\nhonesty to acquaint the king withal, I would not\\r\\ndo't: I hold it the more knavery to conceal it;\\r\\nand therein am I constant to my profession.\\r\\nRe-enter Clown and Shepherd\\r\\n\\r\\nAside, aside; here is more matter for a hot brain:\\r\\nevery lane's end, every shop, church, session,\\r\\nhanging, yields a careful man work.\\r\\nClown\\r\\nSee, see; what a man you are now!\\r\\nThere is no other way but to tell the king\\r\\nshe's a changeling and none of your flesh and blood.\\r\\nShepherd\\r\\nNay, but hear me.\\r\\nClown\\r\\nNay, but hear me.\\r\\nShepherd\\r\\nGo to, then.\\r\\nClown\\r\\nShe being none of your flesh and blood, your flesh\\r\\nand blood has not offended the king; and so your\\r\\nflesh and blood is not to be punished by him. Show\\r\\nthose things you found about her, those secret\\r\\nthings, all but what she has with her: this being\\r\\ndone, let the law go whistle: I warrant you.\\r\\nShepherd\\r\\nI will tell the king all, every word, yea, and his\\r\\nson's pranks too; who, I may say, is no honest man,\\r\\nneither to his father nor to me, to go about to make\\r\\nme the king's brother-in-law.\\r\\nClown\\r\\nIndeed, brother-in-law was the farthest off you\\r\\ncould have been to him and then your blood had been\\r\\nthe dearer by I know how much an ounce.\\r\\nAUTOLYCUS\\r\\n[Aside] Very wisely, puppies!\\r\\nShepherd\\r\\nWell, let us to the king: there is that in this\\r\\nfardel will make him scratch his beard.\\r\\nAUTOLYCUS\\r\\n[Aside] I know not what impediment this complaint\\r\\nmay be to the flight of my master.\\r\\nClown\\r\\nPray heartily he be at palace.\\r\\nAUTOLYCUS\\r\\n[Aside] Though I am not naturally honest, I am so\\r\\nsometimes by chance: let me pocket up my pedlar's excrement.\\r\\nTakes off his false beard\\r\\n\\r\\nHow now, rustics! whither are you bound?\\r\\nShepherd\\r\\nTo the palace, an it like your worship.\\r\\nAUTOLYCUS\\r\\nYour affairs there, what, with whom, the condition\\r\\nof that fardel, the place of your dwelling, your\\r\\nnames, your ages, of what having, breeding, and any\\r\\nthing that is fitting to be known, discover.\\r\\nClown\\r\\nWe are but plain fellows, sir.\\r\\nAUTOLYCUS\\r\\nA lie; you are rough and hairy. Let me have no\\r\\nlying: it becomes none but tradesmen, and they\\r\\noften give us soldiers the lie: but we pay them for\\r\\nit with stamped coin, not stabbing steel; therefore\\r\\nthey do not give us the lie.\\r\\nClown\\r\\nYour worship had like to have given us one, if you\\r\\nhad not taken yourself with the manner.\\r\\nShepherd\\r\\nAre you a courtier, an't like you, sir?\\r\\nAUTOLYCUS\\r\\nWhether it like me or no, I am a courtier. Seest\\r\\nthou not the air of the court in these enfoldings?\\r\\nhath not my gait in it the measure of the court?\\r\\nreceives not thy nose court-odor from me? reflect I\\r\\nnot on thy baseness court-contempt? Thinkest thou,\\r\\nfor that I insinuate, or toaze from thee thy\\r\\nbusiness, I am therefore no courtier? I am courtier\\r\\ncap-a-pe; and one that will either push on or pluck\\r\\nback thy business there: whereupon I command thee to\\r\\nopen thy affair.\\r\\nShepherd\\r\\nMy business, sir, is to the king.\\r\\nAUTOLYCUS\\r\\nWhat advocate hast thou to him?\\r\\nShepherd\\r\\nI know not, an't like you.\\r\\nClown\\r\\nAdvocate's the court-word for a pheasant: say you\\r\\nhave none.\\r\\nShepherd\\r\\nNone, sir; I have no pheasant, cock nor hen.\\r\\nAUTOLYCUS\\r\\nHow blessed are we that are not simple men!\\r\\nYet nature might have made me as these are,\\r\\nTherefore I will not disdain.\\r\\nClown\\r\\nThis cannot be but a great courtier.\\r\\nShepherd\\r\\nHis garments are rich, but he wears\\r\\nthem not handsomely.\\r\\nClown\\r\\nHe seems to be the more noble in being fantastical:\\r\\na great man, I'll warrant; I know by the picking\\r\\non's teeth.\\r\\nAUTOLYCUS\\r\\nThe fardel there? what's i' the fardel?\\r\\nWherefore that box?\\r\\nShepherd\\r\\nSir, there lies such secrets in this fardel and box,\\r\\nwhich none must know but the king; and which he\\r\\nshall know within this hour, if I may come to the\\r\\nspeech of him.\\r\\nAUTOLYCUS\\r\\nAge, thou hast lost thy labour.\\r\\nShepherd\\r\\nWhy, sir?\\r\\nAUTOLYCUS\\r\\nThe king is not at the palace; he is gone aboard a\\r\\nnew ship to purge melancholy and air himself: for,\\r\\nif thou beest capable of things serious, thou must\\r\\nknow the king is full of grief.\\r\\nShepard\\r\\nSo 'tis said, sir; about his son, that should have\\r\\nmarried a shepherd's daughter.\\r\\nAUTOLYCUS\\r\\nIf that shepherd be not in hand-fast, let him fly:\\r\\nthe curses he shall have, the tortures he shall\\r\\nfeel, will break the back of man, the heart of monster.\\r\\nClown\\r\\nThink you so, sir?\\r\\nAUTOLYCUS\\r\\nNot he alone shall suffer what wit can make heavy\\r\\nand vengeance bitter; but those that are germane to\\r\\nhim, though removed fifty times, shall all come\\r\\nunder the hangman: which though it be great pity,\\r\\nyet it is necessary. An old sheep-whistling rogue a\\r\\nram-tender, to offer to have his daughter come into\\r\\ngrace! Some say he shall be stoned; but that death\\r\\nis too soft for him, say I draw our throne into a\\r\\nsheep-cote! all deaths are too few, the sharpest too easy.\\r\\nClown\\r\\nHas the old man e'er a son, sir, do you hear. an't\\r\\nlike you, sir?\\r\\nAUTOLYCUS\\r\\nHe has a son, who shall be flayed alive; then\\r\\n'nointed over with honey, set on the head of a\\r\\nwasp's nest; then stand till he be three quarters\\r\\nand a dram dead; then recovered again with\\r\\naqua-vitae or some other hot infusion; then, raw as\\r\\nhe is, and in the hottest day prognostication\\r\\nproclaims, shall be be set against a brick-wall, the\\r\\nsun looking with a southward eye upon him, where he\\r\\nis to behold him with flies blown to death. But what\\r\\ntalk we of these traitorly rascals, whose miseries\\r\\nare to be smiled at, their offences being so\\r\\ncapital? Tell me, for you seem to be honest plain\\r\\nmen, what you have to the king: being something\\r\\ngently considered, I'll bring you where he is\\r\\naboard, tender your persons to his presence,\\r\\nwhisper him in your behalfs; and if it be in man\\r\\nbesides the king to effect your suits, here is man\\r\\nshall do it.\\r\\nClown\\r\\nHe seems to be of great authority: close with him,\\r\\ngive him gold; and though authority be a stubborn\\r\\nbear, yet he is oft led by the nose with gold: show\\r\\nthe inside of your purse to the outside of his hand,\\r\\nand no more ado. Remember 'stoned,' and 'flayed alive.'\\r\\nShepherd\\r\\nAn't please you, sir, to undertake the business for\\r\\nus, here is that gold I have: I'll make it as much\\r\\nmore and leave this young man in pawn till I bring it you.\\r\\nAUTOLYCUS\\r\\nAfter I have done what I promised?\\r\\nShepherd\\r\\nAy, sir.\\r\\nAUTOLYCUS\\r\\nWell, give me the moiety. Are you a party in this business?\\r\\nClown\\r\\nIn some sort, sir: but though my case be a pitiful\\r\\none, I hope I shall not be flayed out of it.\\r\\nAUTOLYCUS\\r\\nO, that's the case of the shepherd's son: hang him,\\r\\nhe'll be made an example.\\r\\nClown\\r\\nComfort, good comfort! We must to the king and show\\r\\nour strange sights: he must know 'tis none of your\\r\\ndaughter nor my sister; we are gone else. Sir, I\\r\\nwill give you as much as this old man does when the\\r\\nbusiness is performed, and remain, as he says, your\\r\\npawn till it be brought you.\\r\\nAUTOLYCUS\\r\\nI will trust you. Walk before toward the sea-side;\\r\\ngo on the right hand: I will but look upon the\\r\\nhedge and follow you.\\r\\nClown\\r\\nWe are blest in this man, as I may say, even blest.\\r\\nShepherd\\r\\nLet's before as he bids us: he was provided to do us good.\\r\\nExeunt Shepherd and Clown\\r\\n\\r\\nAUTOLYCUS\\r\\nIf I had a mind to be honest, I see Fortune would\\r\\nnot suffer me: she drops booties in my mouth. I am\\r\\ncourted now with a double occasion, gold and a means\\r\\nto do the prince my master good; which who knows how\\r\\nthat may turn back to my advancement? I will bring\\r\\nthese two moles, these blind ones, aboard him: if he\\r\\nthink it fit to shore them again and that the\\r\\ncomplaint they have to the king concerns him\\r\\nnothing, let him call me rogue for being so far\\r\\nofficious; for I am proof against that title and\\r\\nwhat shame else belongs to't. To him will I present\\r\\nthem: there may be matter in it.\\r\\nExit\\r\\n\\r\\nACT V\\r\\nSCENE I. A room in LEONTES' palace.\\r\\nEnter LEONTES, CLEOMENES, DION, PAULINA, and Servants\\r\\nCLEOMENES\\r\\nSir, you have done enough, and have perform'd\\r\\nA saint-like sorrow: no fault could you make,\\r\\nWhich you have not redeem'd; indeed, paid down\\r\\nMore penitence than done trespass: at the last,\\r\\nDo as the heavens have done, forget your evil;\\r\\nWith them forgive yourself.\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nWhilst I remember\\r\\nHer and her virtues, I cannot forget\\r\\nMy blemishes in them, and so still think of\\r\\nThe wrong I did myself; which was so much,\\r\\nThat heirless it hath made my kingdom and\\r\\nDestroy'd the sweet'st companion that e'er man\\r\\nBred his hopes out of.\\r\\nPAULINA\\r\\nTrue, too true, my lord:\\r\\nIf, one by one, you wedded all the world,\\r\\nOr from the all that are took something good,\\r\\nTo make a perfect woman, she you kill'd\\r\\nWould be unparallel'd.\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nI think so. Kill'd!\\r\\nShe I kill'd! I did so: but thou strikest me\\r\\nSorely, to say I did; it is as bitter\\r\\nUpon thy tongue as in my thought: now, good now,\\r\\nSay so but seldom.\\r\\nCLEOMENES\\r\\nNot at all, good lady:\\r\\nYou might have spoken a thousand things that would\\r\\nHave done the time more benefit and graced\\r\\nYour kindness better.\\r\\nPAULINA\\r\\nYou are one of those\\r\\nWould have him wed again.\\r\\nDION\\r\\nIf you would not so,\\r\\nYou pity not the state, nor the remembrance\\r\\nOf his most sovereign name; consider little\\r\\nWhat dangers, by his highness' fail of issue,\\r\\nMay drop upon his kingdom and devour\\r\\nIncertain lookers on. What were more holy\\r\\nThan to rejoice the former queen is well?\\r\\nWhat holier than, for royalty's repair,\\r\\nFor present comfort and for future good,\\r\\nTo bless the bed of majesty again\\r\\nWith a sweet fellow to't?\\r\\nPAULINA\\r\\nThere is none worthy,\\r\\nRespecting her that's gone. Besides, the gods\\r\\nWill have fulfill'd their secret purposes;\\r\\nFor has not the divine Apollo said,\\r\\nIs't not the tenor of his oracle,\\r\\nThat King Leontes shall not have an heir\\r\\nTill his lost child be found? which that it shall,\\r\\nIs all as monstrous to our human reason\\r\\nAs my Antigonus to break his grave\\r\\nAnd come again to me; who, on my life,\\r\\nDid perish with the infant. 'Tis your counsel\\r\\nMy lord should to the heavens be contrary,\\r\\nOppose against their wills.\\r\\nTo LEONTES\\r\\n\\r\\nCare not for issue;\\r\\nThe crown will find an heir: great Alexander\\r\\nLeft his to the worthiest; so his successor\\r\\nWas like to be the best.\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nGood Paulina,\\r\\nWho hast the memory of Hermione,\\r\\nI know, in honour, O, that ever I\\r\\nHad squared me to thy counsel! then, even now,\\r\\nI might have look'd upon my queen's full eyes,\\r\\nHave taken treasure from her lips--\\r\\nPAULINA\\r\\nAnd left them\\r\\nMore rich for what they yielded.\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nThou speak'st truth.\\r\\nNo more such wives; therefore, no wife: one worse,\\r\\nAnd better used, would make her sainted spirit\\r\\nAgain possess her corpse, and on this stage,\\r\\nWhere we're offenders now, appear soul-vex'd,\\r\\nAnd begin, 'Why to me?'\\r\\nPAULINA\\r\\nHad she such power,\\r\\nShe had just cause.\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nShe had; and would incense me\\r\\nTo murder her I married.\\r\\nPAULINA\\r\\nI should so.\\r\\nWere I the ghost that walk'd, I'ld bid you mark\\r\\nHer eye, and tell me for what dull part in't\\r\\nYou chose her; then I'ld shriek, that even your ears\\r\\nShould rift to hear me; and the words that follow'd\\r\\nShould be 'Remember mine.'\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nStars, stars,\\r\\nAnd all eyes else dead coals! Fear thou no wife;\\r\\nI'll have no wife, Paulina.\\r\\nPAULINA\\r\\nWill you swear\\r\\nNever to marry but by my free leave?\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nNever, Paulina; so be blest my spirit!\\r\\nPAULINA\\r\\nThen, good my lords, bear witness to his oath.\\r\\nCLEOMENES\\r\\nYou tempt him over-much.\\r\\nPAULINA\\r\\nUnless another,\\r\\nAs like Hermione as is her picture,\\r\\nAffront his eye.\\r\\nCLEOMENES\\r\\nGood madam,--\\r\\nPAULINA\\r\\nI have done.\\r\\nYet, if my lord will marry,--if you will, sir,\\r\\nNo remedy, but you will,--give me the office\\r\\nTo choose you a queen: she shall not be so young\\r\\nAs was your former; but she shall be such\\r\\nAs, walk'd your first queen's ghost,\\r\\nit should take joy\\r\\nTo see her in your arms.\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nMy true Paulina,\\r\\nWe shall not marry till thou bid'st us.\\r\\nPAULINA\\r\\nThat\\r\\nShall be when your first queen's again in breath;\\r\\nNever till then.\\r\\nEnter a Gentleman\\r\\n\\r\\nGentleman\\r\\nOne that gives out himself Prince Florizel,\\r\\nSon of Polixenes, with his princess, she\\r\\nThe fairest I have yet beheld, desires access\\r\\nTo your high presence.\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nWhat with him? he comes not\\r\\nLike to his father's greatness: his approach,\\r\\nSo out of circumstance and sudden, tells us\\r\\n'Tis not a visitation framed, but forced\\r\\nBy need and accident. What train?\\r\\nGentleman\\r\\nBut few,\\r\\nAnd those but mean.\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nHis princess, say you, with him?\\r\\nGentleman\\r\\nAy, the most peerless piece of earth, I think,\\r\\nThat e'er the sun shone bright on.\\r\\nPAULINA\\r\\nO Hermione,\\r\\nAs every present time doth boast itself\\r\\nAbove a better gone, so must thy grave\\r\\nGive way to what's seen now! Sir, you yourself\\r\\nHave said and writ so, but your writing now\\r\\nIs colder than that theme, 'She had not been,\\r\\nNor was not to be equall'd;'--thus your verse\\r\\nFlow'd with her beauty once: 'tis shrewdly ebb'd,\\r\\nTo say you have seen a better.\\r\\nGentleman\\r\\nPardon, madam:\\r\\nThe one I have almost forgot,--your pardon,--\\r\\nThe other, when she has obtain'd your eye,\\r\\nWill have your tongue too. This is a creature,\\r\\nWould she begin a sect, might quench the zeal\\r\\nOf all professors else, make proselytes\\r\\nOf who she but bid follow.\\r\\nPAULINA\\r\\nHow! not women?\\r\\nGentleman\\r\\nWomen will love her, that she is a woman\\r\\nMore worth than any man; men, that she is\\r\\nThe rarest of all women.\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nGo, Cleomenes;\\r\\nYourself, assisted with your honour'd friends,\\r\\nBring them to our embracement. Still, 'tis strange\\r\\nExeunt CLEOMENES and others\\r\\n\\r\\nHe thus should steal upon us.\\r\\nPAULINA\\r\\nHad our prince,\\r\\nJewel of children, seen this hour, he had pair'd\\r\\nWell with this lord: there was not full a month\\r\\nBetween their births.\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nPrithee, no more; cease; thou know'st\\r\\nHe dies to me again when talk'd of: sure,\\r\\nWhen I shall see this gentleman, thy speeches\\r\\nWill bring me to consider that which may\\r\\nUnfurnish me of reason. They are come.\\r\\nRe-enter CLEOMENES and others, with FLORIZEL and PERDITA\\r\\n\\r\\nYour mother was most true to wedlock, prince;\\r\\nFor she did print your royal father off,\\r\\nConceiving you: were I but twenty-one,\\r\\nYour father's image is so hit in you,\\r\\nHis very air, that I should call you brother,\\r\\nAs I did him, and speak of something wildly\\r\\nBy us perform'd before. Most dearly welcome!\\r\\nAnd your fair princess,--goddess!--O, alas!\\r\\nI lost a couple, that 'twixt heaven and earth\\r\\nMight thus have stood begetting wonder as\\r\\nYou, gracious couple, do: and then I lost--\\r\\nAll mine own folly--the society,\\r\\nAmity too, of your brave father, whom,\\r\\nThough bearing misery, I desire my life\\r\\nOnce more to look on him.\\r\\nFLORIZEL\\r\\nBy his command\\r\\nHave I here touch'd Sicilia and from him\\r\\nGive you all greetings that a king, at friend,\\r\\nCan send his brother: and, but infirmity\\r\\nWhich waits upon worn times hath something seized\\r\\nHis wish'd ability, he had himself\\r\\nThe lands and waters 'twixt your throne and his\\r\\nMeasured to look upon you; whom he loves--\\r\\nHe bade me say so--more than all the sceptres\\r\\nAnd those that bear them living.\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nO my brother,\\r\\nGood gentleman! the wrongs I have done thee stir\\r\\nAfresh within me, and these thy offices,\\r\\nSo rarely kind, are as interpreters\\r\\nOf my behind-hand slackness. Welcome hither,\\r\\nAs is the spring to the earth. And hath he too\\r\\nExposed this paragon to the fearful usage,\\r\\nAt least ungentle, of the dreadful Neptune,\\r\\nTo greet a man not worth her pains, much less\\r\\nThe adventure of her person?\\r\\nFLORIZEL\\r\\nGood my lord,\\r\\nShe came from Libya.\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nWhere the warlike Smalus,\\r\\nThat noble honour'd lord, is fear'd and loved?\\r\\nFLORIZEL\\r\\nMost royal sir, from thence; from him, whose daughter\\r\\nHis tears proclaim'd his, parting with her: thence,\\r\\nA prosperous south-wind friendly, we have cross'd,\\r\\nTo execute the charge my father gave me\\r\\nFor visiting your highness: my best train\\r\\nI have from your Sicilian shores dismiss'd;\\r\\nWho for Bohemia bend, to signify\\r\\nNot only my success in Libya, sir,\\r\\nBut my arrival and my wife's in safety\\r\\nHere where we are.\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nThe blessed gods\\r\\nPurge all infection from our air whilst you\\r\\nDo climate here! You have a holy father,\\r\\nA graceful gentleman; against whose person,\\r\\nSo sacred as it is, I have done sin:\\r\\nFor which the heavens, taking angry note,\\r\\nHave left me issueless; and your father's blest,\\r\\nAs he from heaven merits it, with you\\r\\nWorthy his goodness. What might I have been,\\r\\nMight I a son and daughter now have look'd on,\\r\\nSuch goodly things as you!\\r\\nEnter a Lord\\r\\n\\r\\nLord\\r\\nMost noble sir,\\r\\nThat which I shall report will bear no credit,\\r\\nWere not the proof so nigh. Please you, great sir,\\r\\nBohemia greets you from himself by me;\\r\\nDesires you to attach his son, who has--\\r\\nHis dignity and duty both cast off--\\r\\nFled from his father, from his hopes, and with\\r\\nA shepherd's daughter.\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nWhere's Bohemia? speak.\\r\\nLord\\r\\nHere in your city; I now came from him:\\r\\nI speak amazedly; and it becomes\\r\\nMy marvel and my message. To your court\\r\\nWhiles he was hastening, in the chase, it seems,\\r\\nOf this fair couple, meets he on the way\\r\\nThe father of this seeming lady and\\r\\nHer brother, having both their country quitted\\r\\nWith this young prince.\\r\\nFLORIZEL\\r\\nCamillo has betray'd me;\\r\\nWhose honour and whose honesty till now\\r\\nEndured all weathers.\\r\\nLord\\r\\nLay't so to his charge:\\r\\nHe's with the king your father.\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nWho? Camillo?\\r\\nLord\\r\\nCamillo, sir; I spake with him; who now\\r\\nHas these poor men in question. Never saw I\\r\\nWretches so quake: they kneel, they kiss the earth;\\r\\nForswear themselves as often as they speak:\\r\\nBohemia stops his ears, and threatens them\\r\\nWith divers deaths in death.\\r\\nPERDITA\\r\\nO my poor father!\\r\\nThe heaven sets spies upon us, will not have\\r\\nOur contract celebrated.\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nYou are married?\\r\\nFLORIZEL\\r\\nWe are not, sir, nor are we like to be;\\r\\nThe stars, I see, will kiss the valleys first:\\r\\nThe odds for high and low's alike.\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nMy lord,\\r\\nIs this the daughter of a king?\\r\\nFLORIZEL\\r\\nShe is,\\r\\nWhen once she is my wife.\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nThat 'once' I see by your good father's speed\\r\\nWill come on very slowly. I am sorry,\\r\\nMost sorry, you have broken from his liking\\r\\nWhere you were tied in duty, and as sorry\\r\\nYour choice is not so rich in worth as beauty,\\r\\nThat you might well enjoy her.\\r\\nFLORIZEL\\r\\nDear, look up:\\r\\nThough Fortune, visible an enemy,\\r\\nShould chase us with my father, power no jot\\r\\nHath she to change our loves. Beseech you, sir,\\r\\nRemember since you owed no more to time\\r\\nThan I do now: with thought of such affections,\\r\\nStep forth mine advocate; at your request\\r\\nMy father will grant precious things as trifles.\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nWould he do so, I'ld beg your precious mistress,\\r\\nWhich he counts but a trifle.\\r\\nPAULINA\\r\\nSir, my liege,\\r\\nYour eye hath too much youth in't: not a month\\r\\n'Fore your queen died, she was more worth such gazes\\r\\nThan what you look on now.\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nI thought of her,\\r\\nEven in these looks I made.\\r\\nTo FLORIZEL\\r\\n\\r\\nBut your petition\\r\\nIs yet unanswer'd. I will to your father:\\r\\nYour honour not o'erthrown by your desires,\\r\\nI am friend to them and you: upon which errand\\r\\nI now go toward him; therefore follow me\\r\\nAnd mark what way I make: come, good my lord.\\r\\nExeunt\\r\\n\\r\\nSCENE II. Before LEONTES' palace.\\r\\nEnter AUTOLYCUS and a Gentleman\\r\\nAUTOLYCUS\\r\\nBeseech you, sir, were you present at this relation?\\r\\nFirst Gentleman\\r\\nI was by at the opening of the fardel, heard the old\\r\\nshepherd deliver the manner how he found it:\\r\\nwhereupon, after a little amazedness, we were all\\r\\ncommanded out of the chamber; only this methought I\\r\\nheard the shepherd say, he found the child.\\r\\nAUTOLYCUS\\r\\nI would most gladly know the issue of it.\\r\\nFirst Gentleman\\r\\nI make a broken delivery of the business; but the\\r\\nchanges I perceived in the king and Camillo were\\r\\nvery notes of admiration: they seemed almost, with\\r\\nstaring on one another, to tear the cases of their\\r\\neyes; there was speech in their dumbness, language\\r\\nin their very gesture; they looked as they had heard\\r\\nof a world ransomed, or one destroyed: a notable\\r\\npassion of wonder appeared in them; but the wisest\\r\\nbeholder, that knew no more but seeing, could not\\r\\nsay if the importance were joy or sorrow; but in the\\r\\nextremity of the one, it must needs be.\\r\\nEnter another Gentleman\\r\\n\\r\\nHere comes a gentleman that haply knows more.\\r\\nThe news, Rogero?\\r\\nSecond Gentleman\\r\\nNothing but bonfires: the oracle is fulfilled; the\\r\\nking's daughter is found: such a deal of wonder is\\r\\nbroken out within this hour that ballad-makers\\r\\ncannot be able to express it.\\r\\nEnter a third Gentleman\\r\\n\\r\\nHere comes the Lady Paulina's steward: he can\\r\\ndeliver you more. How goes it now, sir? this news\\r\\nwhich is called true is so like an old tale, that\\r\\nthe verity of it is in strong suspicion: has the king\\r\\nfound his heir?\\r\\nThird Gentleman\\r\\nMost true, if ever truth were pregnant by\\r\\ncircumstance: that which you hear you'll swear you\\r\\nsee, there is such unity in the proofs. The mantle\\r\\nof Queen Hermione's, her jewel about the neck of it,\\r\\nthe letters of Antigonus found with it which they\\r\\nknow to be his character, the majesty of the\\r\\ncreature in resemblance of the mother, the affection\\r\\nof nobleness which nature shows above her breeding,\\r\\nand many other evidences proclaim her with all\\r\\ncertainty to be the king's daughter. Did you see\\r\\nthe meeting of the two kings?\\r\\nSecond Gentleman\\r\\nNo.\\r\\nThird Gentleman\\r\\nThen have you lost a sight, which was to be seen,\\r\\ncannot be spoken of. There might you have beheld one\\r\\njoy crown another, so and in such manner that it\\r\\nseemed sorrow wept to take leave of them, for their\\r\\njoy waded in tears. There was casting up of eyes,\\r\\nholding up of hands, with countenances of such\\r\\ndistraction that they were to be known by garment,\\r\\nnot by favour. Our king, being ready to leap out of\\r\\nhimself for joy of his found daughter, as if that\\r\\njoy were now become a loss, cries 'O, thy mother,\\r\\nthy mother!' then asks Bohemia forgiveness; then\\r\\nembraces his son-in-law; then again worries he his\\r\\ndaughter with clipping her; now he thanks the old\\r\\nshepherd, which stands by like a weather-bitten\\r\\nconduit of many kings' reigns. I never heard of such\\r\\nanother encounter, which lames report to follow it\\r\\nand undoes description to do it.\\r\\nSecond Gentleman\\r\\nWhat, pray you, became of Antigonus, that carried\\r\\nhence the child?\\r\\nThird Gentleman\\r\\nLike an old tale still, which will have matter to\\r\\nrehearse, though credit be asleep and not an ear\\r\\nopen. He was torn to pieces with a bear: this\\r\\navouches the shepherd's son; who has not only his\\r\\ninnocence, which seems much, to justify him, but a\\r\\nhandkerchief and rings of his that Paulina knows.\\r\\nFirst Gentleman\\r\\nWhat became of his bark and his followers?\\r\\nThird Gentleman\\r\\nWrecked the same instant of their master's death and\\r\\nin the view of the shepherd: so that all the\\r\\ninstruments which aided to expose the child were\\r\\neven then lost when it was found. But O, the noble\\r\\ncombat that 'twixt joy and sorrow was fought in\\r\\nPaulina! She had one eye declined for the loss of\\r\\nher husband, another elevated that the oracle was\\r\\nfulfilled: she lifted the princess from the earth,\\r\\nand so locks her in embracing, as if she would pin\\r\\nher to her heart that she might no more be in danger\\r\\nof losing.\\r\\nFirst Gentleman\\r\\nThe dignity of this act was worth the audience of\\r\\nkings and princes; for by such was it acted.\\r\\nThird Gentleman\\r\\nOne of the prettiest touches of all and that which\\r\\nangled for mine eyes, caught the water though not\\r\\nthe fish, was when, at the relation of the queen's\\r\\ndeath, with the manner how she came to't bravely\\r\\nconfessed and lamented by the king, how\\r\\nattentiveness wounded his daughter; till, from one\\r\\nsign of dolour to another, she did, with an 'Alas,'\\r\\nI would fain say, bleed tears, for I am sure my\\r\\nheart wept blood. Who was most marble there changed\\r\\ncolour; some swooned, all sorrowed: if all the world\\r\\ncould have seen 't, the woe had been universal.\\r\\nFirst Gentleman\\r\\nAre they returned to the court?\\r\\nThird Gentleman\\r\\nNo: the princess hearing of her mother's statue,\\r\\nwhich is in the keeping of Paulina,--a piece many\\r\\nyears in doing and now newly performed by that rare\\r\\nItalian master, Julio Romano, who, had he himself\\r\\neternity and could put breath into his work, would\\r\\nbeguile Nature of her custom, so perfectly he is her\\r\\nape: he so near to Hermione hath done Hermione that\\r\\nthey say one would speak to her and stand in hope of\\r\\nanswer: thither with all greediness of affection\\r\\nare they gone, and there they intend to sup.\\r\\nSecond Gentleman\\r\\nI thought she had some great matter there in hand;\\r\\nfor she hath privately twice or thrice a day, ever\\r\\nsince the death of Hermione, visited that removed\\r\\nhouse. Shall we thither and with our company piece\\r\\nthe rejoicing?\\r\\nFirst Gentleman\\r\\nWho would be thence that has the benefit of access?\\r\\nevery wink of an eye some new grace will be born:\\r\\nour absence makes us unthrifty to our knowledge.\\r\\nLet's along.\\r\\nExeunt Gentlemen\\r\\n\\r\\nAUTOLYCUS\\r\\nNow, had I not the dash of my former life in me,\\r\\nwould preferment drop on my head. I brought the old\\r\\nman and his son aboard the prince: told him I heard\\r\\nthem talk of a fardel and I know not what: but he\\r\\nat that time, overfond of the shepherd's daughter,\\r\\nso he then took her to be, who began to be much\\r\\nsea-sick, and himself little better, extremity of\\r\\nweather continuing, this mystery remained\\r\\nundiscovered. But 'tis all one to me; for had I\\r\\nbeen the finder out of this secret, it would not\\r\\nhave relished among my other discredits.\\r\\nEnter Shepherd and Clown\\r\\n\\r\\nHere come those I have done good to against my will,\\r\\nand already appearing in the blossoms of their fortune.\\r\\nShepherd\\r\\nCome, boy; I am past moe children, but thy sons and\\r\\ndaughters will be all gentlemen born.\\r\\nClown\\r\\nYou are well met, sir. You denied to fight with me\\r\\nthis other day, because I was no gentleman born.\\r\\nSee you these clothes? say you see them not and\\r\\nthink me still no gentleman born: you were best say\\r\\nthese robes are not gentlemen born: give me the\\r\\nlie, do, and try whether I am not now a gentleman born.\\r\\nAUTOLYCUS\\r\\nI know you are now, sir, a gentleman born.\\r\\nClown\\r\\nAy, and have been so any time these four hours.\\r\\nShepherd\\r\\nAnd so have I, boy.\\r\\nClown\\r\\nSo you have: but I was a gentleman born before my\\r\\nfather; for the king's son took me by the hand, and\\r\\ncalled me brother; and then the two kings called my\\r\\nfather brother; and then the prince my brother and\\r\\nthe princess my sister called my father father; and\\r\\nso we wept, and there was the first gentleman-like\\r\\ntears that ever we shed.\\r\\nShepherd\\r\\nWe may live, son, to shed many more.\\r\\nClown\\r\\nAy; or else 'twere hard luck, being in so\\r\\npreposterous estate as we are.\\r\\nAUTOLYCUS\\r\\nI humbly beseech you, sir, to pardon me all the\\r\\nfaults I have committed to your worship and to give\\r\\nme your good report to the prince my master.\\r\\nShepherd\\r\\nPrithee, son, do; for we must be gentle, now we are\\r\\ngentlemen.\\r\\nClown\\r\\nThou wilt amend thy life?\\r\\nAUTOLYCUS\\r\\nAy, an it like your good worship.\\r\\nClown\\r\\nGive me thy hand: I will swear to the prince thou\\r\\nart as honest a true fellow as any is in Bohemia.\\r\\nShepherd\\r\\nYou may say it, but not swear it.\\r\\nClown\\r\\nNot swear it, now I am a gentleman? Let boors and\\r\\nfranklins say it, I'll swear it.\\r\\nShepherd\\r\\nHow if it be false, son?\\r\\nClown\\r\\nIf it be ne'er so false, a true gentleman may swear\\r\\nit in the behalf of his friend: and I'll swear to\\r\\nthe prince thou art a tall fellow of thy hands and\\r\\nthat thou wilt not be drunk; but I know thou art no\\r\\ntall fellow of thy hands and that thou wilt be\\r\\ndrunk: but I'll swear it, and I would thou wouldst\\r\\nbe a tall fellow of thy hands.\\r\\nAUTOLYCUS\\r\\nI will prove so, sir, to my power.\\r\\nClown\\r\\nAy, by any means prove a tall fellow: if I do not\\r\\nwonder how thou darest venture to be drunk, not\\r\\nbeing a tall fellow, trust me not. Hark! the kings\\r\\nand the princes, our kindred, are going to see the\\r\\nqueen's picture. Come, follow us: we'll be thy\\r\\ngood masters.\\r\\nExeunt\\r\\n\\r\\nSCENE III. A chapel in PAULINA'S house.\\r\\nEnter LEONTES, POLIXENES, FLORIZEL, PERDITA, CAMILLO, PAULINA, Lords, and Attendants\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nO grave and good Paulina, the great comfort\\r\\nThat I have had of thee!\\r\\nPAULINA\\r\\nWhat, sovereign sir,\\r\\nI did not well I meant well. All my services\\r\\nYou have paid home: but that you have vouchsafed,\\r\\nWith your crown'd brother and these your contracted\\r\\nHeirs of your kingdoms, my poor house to visit,\\r\\nIt is a surplus of your grace, which never\\r\\nMy life may last to answer.\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nO Paulina,\\r\\nWe honour you with trouble: but we came\\r\\nTo see the statue of our queen: your gallery\\r\\nHave we pass'd through, not without much content\\r\\nIn many singularities; but we saw not\\r\\nThat which my daughter came to look upon,\\r\\nThe statue of her mother.\\r\\nPAULINA\\r\\nAs she lived peerless,\\r\\nSo her dead likeness, I do well believe,\\r\\nExcels whatever yet you look'd upon\\r\\nOr hand of man hath done; therefore I keep it\\r\\nLonely, apart. But here it is: prepare\\r\\nTo see the life as lively mock'd as ever\\r\\nStill sleep mock'd death: behold, and say 'tis well.\\r\\nPAULINA draws a curtain, and discovers HERMIONE standing like a statue\\r\\n\\r\\nI like your silence, it the more shows off\\r\\nYour wonder: but yet speak; first, you, my liege,\\r\\nComes it not something near?\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nHer natural posture!\\r\\nChide me, dear stone, that I may say indeed\\r\\nThou art Hermione; or rather, thou art she\\r\\nIn thy not chiding, for she was as tender\\r\\nAs infancy and grace. But yet, Paulina,\\r\\nHermione was not so much wrinkled, nothing\\r\\nSo aged as this seems.\\r\\nPOLIXENES\\r\\nO, not by much.\\r\\nPAULINA\\r\\nSo much the more our carver's excellence;\\r\\nWhich lets go by some sixteen years and makes her\\r\\nAs she lived now.\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nAs now she might have done,\\r\\nSo much to my good comfort, as it is\\r\\nNow piercing to my soul. O, thus she stood,\\r\\nEven with such life of majesty, warm life,\\r\\nAs now it coldly stands, when first I woo'd her!\\r\\nI am ashamed: does not the stone rebuke me\\r\\nFor being more stone than it? O royal piece,\\r\\nThere's magic in thy majesty, which has\\r\\nMy evils conjured to remembrance and\\r\\nFrom thy admiring daughter took the spirits,\\r\\nStanding like stone with thee.\\r\\nPERDITA\\r\\nAnd give me leave,\\r\\nAnd do not say 'tis superstition, that\\r\\nI kneel and then implore her blessing. Lady,\\r\\nDear queen, that ended when I but began,\\r\\nGive me that hand of yours to kiss.\\r\\nPAULINA\\r\\nO, patience!\\r\\nThe statue is but newly fix'd, the colour's Not dry.\\r\\nCAMILLO\\r\\nMy lord, your sorrow was too sore laid on,\\r\\nWhich sixteen winters cannot blow away,\\r\\nSo many summers dry; scarce any joy\\r\\nDid ever so long live; no sorrow\\r\\nBut kill'd itself much sooner.\\r\\nPOLIXENES\\r\\nDear my brother,\\r\\nLet him that was the cause of this have power\\r\\nTo take off so much grief from you as he\\r\\nWill piece up in himself.\\r\\nPAULINA\\r\\nIndeed, my lord,\\r\\nIf I had thought the sight of my poor image\\r\\nWould thus have wrought you,--for the stone is mine--\\r\\nI'ld not have show'd it.\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nDo not draw the curtain.\\r\\nPAULINA\\r\\nNo longer shall you gaze on't, lest your fancy\\r\\nMay think anon it moves.\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nLet be, let be.\\r\\nWould I were dead, but that, methinks, already--\\r\\nWhat was he that did make it? See, my lord,\\r\\nWould you not deem it breathed? and that those veins\\r\\nDid verily bear blood?\\r\\nPOLIXENES\\r\\nMasterly done:\\r\\nThe very life seems warm upon her lip.\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nThe fixture of her eye has motion in't,\\r\\nAs we are mock'd with art.\\r\\nPAULINA\\r\\nI'll draw the curtain:\\r\\nMy lord's almost so far transported that\\r\\nHe'll think anon it lives.\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nO sweet Paulina,\\r\\nMake me to think so twenty years together!\\r\\nNo settled senses of the world can match\\r\\nThe pleasure of that madness. Let 't alone.\\r\\nPAULINA\\r\\nI am sorry, sir, I have thus far stirr'd you: but\\r\\nI could afflict you farther.\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nDo, Paulina;\\r\\nFor this affliction has a taste as sweet\\r\\nAs any cordial comfort. Still, methinks,\\r\\nThere is an air comes from her: what fine chisel\\r\\nCould ever yet cut breath? Let no man mock me,\\r\\nFor I will kiss her.\\r\\nPAULINA\\r\\nGood my lord, forbear:\\r\\nThe ruddiness upon her lip is wet;\\r\\nYou'll mar it if you kiss it, stain your own\\r\\nWith oily painting. Shall I draw the curtain?\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nNo, not these twenty years.\\r\\nPERDITA\\r\\nSo long could I\\r\\nStand by, a looker on.\\r\\nPAULINA\\r\\nEither forbear,\\r\\nQuit presently the chapel, or resolve you\\r\\nFor more amazement. If you can behold it,\\r\\nI'll make the statue move indeed, descend\\r\\nAnd take you by the hand; but then you'll think--\\r\\nWhich I protest against--I am assisted\\r\\nBy wicked powers.\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nWhat you can make her do,\\r\\nI am content to look on: what to speak,\\r\\nI am content to hear; for 'tis as easy\\r\\nTo make her speak as move.\\r\\nPAULINA\\r\\nIt is required\\r\\nYou do awake your faith. Then all stand still;\\r\\nOn: those that think it is unlawful business\\r\\nI am about, let them depart.\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nProceed:\\r\\nNo foot shall stir.\\r\\nPAULINA\\r\\nMusic, awake her; strike!\\r\\nMusic\\r\\n\\r\\n'Tis time; descend; be stone no more; approach;\\r\\nStrike all that look upon with marvel. Come,\\r\\nI'll fill your grave up: stir, nay, come away,\\r\\nBequeath to death your numbness, for from him\\r\\nDear life redeems you. You perceive she stirs:\\r\\nHERMIONE comes down\\r\\n\\r\\nStart not; her actions shall be holy as\\r\\nYou hear my spell is lawful: do not shun her\\r\\nUntil you see her die again; for then\\r\\nYou kill her double. Nay, present your hand:\\r\\nWhen she was young you woo'd her; now in age\\r\\nIs she become the suitor?\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nO, she's warm!\\r\\nIf this be magic, let it be an art\\r\\nLawful as eating.\\r\\nPOLIXENES\\r\\nShe embraces him.\\r\\nCAMILLO\\r\\nShe hangs about his neck:\\r\\nIf she pertain to life let her speak too.\\r\\nPOLIXENES\\r\\nAy, and make't manifest where she has lived,\\r\\nOr how stolen from the dead.\\r\\nPAULINA\\r\\nThat she is living,\\r\\nWere it but told you, should be hooted at\\r\\nLike an old tale: but it appears she lives,\\r\\nThough yet she speak not. Mark a little while.\\r\\nPlease you to interpose, fair madam: kneel\\r\\nAnd pray your mother's blessing. Turn, good lady;\\r\\nOur Perdita is found.\\r\\nHERMIONE\\r\\nYou gods, look down\\r\\nAnd from your sacred vials pour your graces\\r\\nUpon my daughter's head! Tell me, mine own.\\r\\nWhere hast thou been preserved? where lived? how found\\r\\nThy father's court? for thou shalt hear that I,\\r\\nKnowing by Paulina that the oracle\\r\\nGave hope thou wast in being, have preserved\\r\\nMyself to see the issue.\\r\\nPAULINA\\r\\nThere's time enough for that;\\r\\nLest they desire upon this push to trouble\\r\\nYour joys with like relation. Go together,\\r\\nYou precious winners all; your exultation\\r\\nPartake to every one. I, an old turtle,\\r\\nWill wing me to some wither'd bough and there\\r\\nMy mate, that's never to be found again,\\r\\nLament till I am lost.\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nO, peace, Paulina!\\r\\nThou shouldst a husband take by my consent,\\r\\nAs I by thine a wife: this is a match,\\r\\nAnd made between's by vows. Thou hast found mine;\\r\\nBut how, is to be question'd; for I saw her,\\r\\nAs I thought, dead, and have in vain said many\\r\\nA prayer upon her grave. I'll not seek far--\\r\\nFor him, I partly know his mind--to find thee\\r\\nAn honourable husband. Come, Camillo,\\r\\nAnd take her by the hand, whose worth and honesty\\r\\nIs richly noted and here justified\\r\\nBy us, a pair of kings. Let's from this place.\\r\\nWhat! look upon my brother: both your pardons,\\r\\nThat e'er I put between your holy looks\\r\\nMy ill suspicion. This is your son-in-law,\\r\\nAnd son unto the king, who, heavens directing,\\r\\nIs troth-plight to your daughter. Good Paulina,\\r\\nLead us from hence, where we may leisurely\\r\\nEach one demand an answer to his part\\r\\nPerform'd in this wide gap of time since first\\r\\nWe were dissever'd: hastily lead away.\\r\\nExeun\",\n",
              " \"\\nACT I\\r\\nSCENE I. Rousillon. The COUNT's palace.\\r\\nEnter BERTRAM, the COUNTESS of Rousillon, HELENA, and LAFEU, all in black\\r\\nCOUNTESS\\r\\nIn delivering my son from me, I bury a second husband.\\r\\nBERTRAM\\r\\nAnd I in going, madam, weep o'er my father's death\\r\\nanew: but I must attend his majesty's command, to\\r\\nwhom I am now in ward, evermore in subjection.\\r\\nLAFEU\\r\\nYou shall find of the king a husband, madam; you,\\r\\nsir, a father: he that so generally is at all times\\r\\ngood must of necessity hold his virtue to you; whose\\r\\nworthiness would stir it up where it wanted rather\\r\\nthan lack it where there is such abundance.\\r\\nCOUNTESS\\r\\nWhat hope is there of his majesty's amendment?\\r\\nLAFEU\\r\\nHe hath abandoned his physicians, madam; under whose\\r\\npractises he hath persecuted time with hope, and\\r\\nfinds no other advantage in the process but only the\\r\\nlosing of hope by time.\\r\\nCOUNTESS\\r\\nThis young gentlewoman had a father,--O, that\\r\\n'had'! how sad a passage 'tis!--whose skill was\\r\\nalmost as great as his honesty; had it stretched so\\r\\nfar, would have made nature immortal, and death\\r\\nshould have play for lack of work. Would, for the\\r\\nking's sake, he were living! I think it would be\\r\\nthe death of the king's disease.\\r\\nLAFEU\\r\\nHow called you the man you speak of, madam?\\r\\nCOUNTESS\\r\\nHe was famous, sir, in his profession, and it was\\r\\nhis great right to be so: Gerard de Narbon.\\r\\nLAFEU\\r\\nHe was excellent indeed, madam: the king very\\r\\nlately spoke of him admiringly and mourningly: he\\r\\nwas skilful enough to have lived still, if knowledge\\r\\ncould be set up against mortality.\\r\\nBERTRAM\\r\\nWhat is it, my good lord, the king languishes of?\\r\\nLAFEU\\r\\nA fistula, my lord.\\r\\nBERTRAM\\r\\nI heard not of it before.\\r\\nLAFEU\\r\\nI would it were not notorious. Was this gentlewoman\\r\\nthe daughter of Gerard de Narbon?\\r\\nCOUNTESS\\r\\nHis sole child, my lord, and bequeathed to my\\r\\noverlooking. I have those hopes of her good that\\r\\nher education promises; her dispositions she\\r\\ninherits, which makes fair gifts fairer; for where\\r\\nan unclean mind carries virtuous qualities, there\\r\\ncommendations go with pity; they are virtues and\\r\\ntraitors too; in her they are the better for their\\r\\nsimpleness; she derives her honesty and achieves her goodness.\\r\\nLAFEU\\r\\nYour commendations, madam, get from her tears.\\r\\nCOUNTESS\\r\\n'Tis the best brine a maiden can season her praise\\r\\nin. The remembrance of her father never approaches\\r\\nher heart but the tyranny of her sorrows takes all\\r\\nlivelihood from her cheek. No more of this, Helena;\\r\\ngo to, no more; lest it be rather thought you affect\\r\\na sorrow than have it.\\r\\nHELENA\\r\\nI do affect a sorrow indeed, but I have it too.\\r\\nLAFEU\\r\\nModerate lamentation is the right of the dead,\\r\\nexcessive grief the enemy to the living.\\r\\nCOUNTESS\\r\\nIf the living be enemy to the grief, the excess\\r\\nmakes it soon mortal.\\r\\nBERTRAM\\r\\nMadam, I desire your holy wishes.\\r\\nLAFEU\\r\\nHow understand we that?\\r\\nCOUNTESS\\r\\nBe thou blest, Bertram, and succeed thy father\\r\\nIn manners, as in shape! thy blood and virtue\\r\\nContend for empire in thee, and thy goodness\\r\\nShare with thy birthright! Love all, trust a few,\\r\\nDo wrong to none: be able for thine enemy\\r\\nRather in power than use, and keep thy friend\\r\\nUnder thy own life's key: be cheque'd for silence,\\r\\nBut never tax'd for speech. What heaven more will,\\r\\nThat thee may furnish and my prayers pluck down,\\r\\nFall on thy head! Farewell, my lord;\\r\\n'Tis an unseason'd courtier; good my lord,\\r\\nAdvise him.\\r\\nLAFEU\\r\\nHe cannot want the best\\r\\nThat shall attend his love.\\r\\nCOUNTESS\\r\\nHeaven bless him! Farewell, Bertram.\\r\\nExit\\r\\n\\r\\nBERTRAM\\r\\n[To HELENA] The best wishes that can be forged in\\r\\nyour thoughts be servants to you! Be comfortable\\r\\nto my mother, your mistress, and make much of her.\\r\\nLAFEU\\r\\nFarewell, pretty lady: you must hold the credit of\\r\\nyour father.\\r\\nExeunt BERTRAM and LAFEU\\r\\n\\r\\nHELENA\\r\\nO, were that all! I think not on my father;\\r\\nAnd these great tears grace his remembrance more\\r\\nThan those I shed for him. What was he like?\\r\\nI have forgot him: my imagination\\r\\nCarries no favour in't but Bertram's.\\r\\nI am undone: there is no living, none,\\r\\nIf Bertram be away. 'Twere all one\\r\\nThat I should love a bright particular star\\r\\nAnd think to wed it, he is so above me:\\r\\nIn his bright radiance and collateral light\\r\\nMust I be comforted, not in his sphere.\\r\\nThe ambition in my love thus plagues itself:\\r\\nThe hind that would be mated by the lion\\r\\nMust die for love. 'Twas pretty, though plague,\\r\\nTo see him every hour; to sit and draw\\r\\nHis arched brows, his hawking eye, his curls,\\r\\nIn our heart's table; heart too capable\\r\\nOf every line and trick of his sweet favour:\\r\\nBut now he's gone, and my idolatrous fancy\\r\\nMust sanctify his reliques. Who comes here?\\r\\nEnter PAROLLES\\r\\n\\r\\nAside\\r\\n\\r\\nOne that goes with him: I love him for his sake;\\r\\nAnd yet I know him a notorious liar,\\r\\nThink him a great way fool, solely a coward;\\r\\nYet these fixed evils sit so fit in him,\\r\\nThat they take place, when virtue's steely bones\\r\\nLook bleak i' the cold wind: withal, full oft we see\\r\\nCold wisdom waiting on superfluous folly.\\r\\nPAROLLES\\r\\nSave you, fair queen!\\r\\nHELENA\\r\\nAnd you, monarch!\\r\\nPAROLLES\\r\\nNo.\\r\\nHELENA\\r\\nAnd no.\\r\\nPAROLLES\\r\\nAre you meditating on virginity?\\r\\nHELENA\\r\\nAy. You have some stain of soldier in you: let me\\r\\nask you a question. Man is enemy to virginity; how\\r\\nmay we barricado it against him?\\r\\nPAROLLES\\r\\nKeep him out.\\r\\nHELENA\\r\\nBut he assails; and our virginity, though valiant,\\r\\nin the defence yet is weak: unfold to us some\\r\\nwarlike resistance.\\r\\nPAROLLES\\r\\nThere is none: man, sitting down before you, will\\r\\nundermine you and blow you up.\\r\\nHELENA\\r\\nBless our poor virginity from underminers and\\r\\nblowers up! Is there no military policy, how\\r\\nvirgins might blow up men?\\r\\nPAROLLES\\r\\nVirginity being blown down, man will quicklier be\\r\\nblown up: marry, in blowing him down again, with\\r\\nthe breach yourselves made, you lose your city. It\\r\\nis not politic in the commonwealth of nature to\\r\\npreserve virginity. Loss of virginity is rational\\r\\nincrease and there was never virgin got till\\r\\nvirginity was first lost. That you were made of is\\r\\nmetal to make virgins. Virginity by being once lost\\r\\nmay be ten times found; by being ever kept, it is\\r\\never lost: 'tis too cold a companion; away with 't!\\r\\nHELENA\\r\\nI will stand for 't a little, though therefore I die a virgin.\\r\\nPAROLLES\\r\\nThere's little can be said in 't; 'tis against the\\r\\nrule of nature. To speak on the part of virginity,\\r\\nis to accuse your mothers; which is most infallible\\r\\ndisobedience. He that hangs himself is a virgin:\\r\\nvirginity murders itself and should be buried in\\r\\nhighways out of all sanctified limit, as a desperate\\r\\noffendress against nature. Virginity breeds mites,\\r\\nmuch like a cheese; consumes itself to the very\\r\\nparing, and so dies with feeding his own stomach.\\r\\nBesides, virginity is peevish, proud, idle, made of\\r\\nself-love, which is the most inhibited sin in the\\r\\ncanon. Keep it not; you cannot choose but loose\\r\\nby't: out with 't! within ten year it will make\\r\\nitself ten, which is a goodly increase; and the\\r\\nprincipal itself not much the worse: away with 't!\\r\\nHELENA\\r\\nHow might one do, sir, to lose it to her own liking?\\r\\nPAROLLES\\r\\nLet me see: marry, ill, to like him that ne'er it\\r\\nlikes. 'Tis a commodity will lose the gloss with\\r\\nlying; the longer kept, the less worth: off with 't\\r\\nwhile 'tis vendible; answer the time of request.\\r\\nVirginity, like an old courtier, wears her cap out\\r\\nof fashion: richly suited, but unsuitable: just\\r\\nlike the brooch and the tooth-pick, which wear not\\r\\nnow. Your date is better in your pie and your\\r\\nporridge than in your cheek; and your virginity,\\r\\nyour old virginity, is like one of our French\\r\\nwithered pears, it looks ill, it eats drily; marry,\\r\\n'tis a withered pear; it was formerly better;\\r\\nmarry, yet 'tis a withered pear: will you anything with it?\\r\\nHELENA\\r\\nNot my virginity yet [ ]\\r\\nThere shall your master have a thousand loves,\\r\\nA mother and a mistress and a friend,\\r\\nA phoenix, captain and an enemy,\\r\\nA guide, a goddess, and a sovereign,\\r\\nA counsellor, a traitress, and a dear;\\r\\nHis humble ambition, proud humility,\\r\\nHis jarring concord, and his discord dulcet,\\r\\nHis faith, his sweet disaster; with a world\\r\\nOf pretty, fond, adoptious christendoms,\\r\\nThat blinking Cupid gossips. Now shall he--\\r\\nI know not what he shall. God send him well!\\r\\nThe court's a learning place, and he is one--\\r\\nPAROLLES\\r\\nWhat one, i' faith?\\r\\nHELENA\\r\\nThat I wish well. 'Tis pity--\\r\\nPAROLLES\\r\\nWhat's pity?\\r\\nHELENA\\r\\nThat wishing well had not a body in't,\\r\\nWhich might be felt; that we, the poorer born,\\r\\nWhose baser stars do shut us up in wishes,\\r\\nMight with effects of them follow our friends,\\r\\nAnd show what we alone must think, which never\\r\\nReturn us thanks.\\r\\nEnter Page\\r\\n\\r\\nPage\\r\\nMonsieur Parolles, my lord calls for you.\\r\\nExit\\r\\n\\r\\nPAROLLES\\r\\nLittle Helen, farewell; if I can remember thee, I\\r\\nwill think of thee at court.\\r\\nHELENA\\r\\nMonsieur Parolles, you were born under a charitable star.\\r\\nPAROLLES\\r\\nUnder Mars, I.\\r\\nHELENA\\r\\nI especially think, under Mars.\\r\\nPAROLLES\\r\\nWhy under Mars?\\r\\nHELENA\\r\\nThe wars have so kept you under that you must needs\\r\\nbe born under Mars.\\r\\nPAROLLES\\r\\nWhen he was predominant.\\r\\nHELENA\\r\\nWhen he was retrograde, I think, rather.\\r\\nPAROLLES\\r\\nWhy think you so?\\r\\nHELENA\\r\\nYou go so much backward when you fight.\\r\\nPAROLLES\\r\\nThat's for advantage.\\r\\nHELENA\\r\\nSo is running away, when fear proposes the safety;\\r\\nbut the composition that your valour and fear makes\\r\\nin you is a virtue of a good wing, and I like the wear well.\\r\\nPAROLLES\\r\\nI am so full of businesses, I cannot answer thee\\r\\nacutely. I will return perfect courtier; in the\\r\\nwhich, my instruction shall serve to naturalize\\r\\nthee, so thou wilt be capable of a courtier's\\r\\ncounsel and understand what advice shall thrust upon\\r\\nthee; else thou diest in thine unthankfulness, and\\r\\nthine ignorance makes thee away: farewell. When\\r\\nthou hast leisure, say thy prayers; when thou hast\\r\\nnone, remember thy friends; get thee a good husband,\\r\\nand use him as he uses thee; so, farewell.\\r\\nExit\\r\\n\\r\\nHELENA\\r\\nOur remedies oft in ourselves do lie,\\r\\nWhich we ascribe to heaven: the fated sky\\r\\nGives us free scope, only doth backward pull\\r\\nOur slow designs when we ourselves are dull.\\r\\nWhat power is it which mounts my love so high,\\r\\nThat makes me see, and cannot feed mine eye?\\r\\nThe mightiest space in fortune nature brings\\r\\nTo join like likes and kiss like native things.\\r\\nImpossible be strange attempts to those\\r\\nThat weigh their pains in sense and do suppose\\r\\nWhat hath been cannot be: who ever strove\\r\\nSo show her merit, that did miss her love?\\r\\nThe king's disease--my project may deceive me,\\r\\nBut my intents are fix'd and will not leave me.\\r\\nExit\\r\\n\\r\\nSCENE II. Paris. The KING's palace.\\r\\nFlourish of cornets. Enter the KING of France, with letters, and divers Attendants\\r\\nKING\\r\\nThe Florentines and Senoys are by the ears;\\r\\nHave fought with equal fortune and continue\\r\\nA braving war.\\r\\nFirst Lord\\r\\nSo 'tis reported, sir.\\r\\nKING\\r\\nNay, 'tis most credible; we here received it\\r\\nA certainty, vouch'd from our cousin Austria,\\r\\nWith caution that the Florentine will move us\\r\\nFor speedy aid; wherein our dearest friend\\r\\nPrejudicates the business and would seem\\r\\nTo have us make denial.\\r\\nFirst Lord\\r\\nHis love and wisdom,\\r\\nApproved so to your majesty, may plead\\r\\nFor amplest credence.\\r\\nKING\\r\\nHe hath arm'd our answer,\\r\\nAnd Florence is denied before he comes:\\r\\nYet, for our gentlemen that mean to see\\r\\nThe Tuscan service, freely have they leave\\r\\nTo stand on either part.\\r\\nSecond Lord\\r\\nIt well may serve\\r\\nA nursery to our gentry, who are sick\\r\\nFor breathing and exploit.\\r\\nKING\\r\\nWhat's he comes here?\\r\\nEnter BERTRAM, LAFEU, and PAROLLES\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst Lord\\r\\nIt is the Count Rousillon, my good lord,\\r\\nYoung Bertram.\\r\\nKING\\r\\nYouth, thou bear'st thy father's face;\\r\\nFrank nature, rather curious than in haste,\\r\\nHath well composed thee. Thy father's moral parts\\r\\nMayst thou inherit too! Welcome to Paris.\\r\\nBERTRAM\\r\\nMy thanks and duty are your majesty's.\\r\\nKING\\r\\nI would I had that corporal soundness now,\\r\\nAs when thy father and myself in friendship\\r\\nFirst tried our soldiership! He did look far\\r\\nInto the service of the time and was\\r\\nDiscipled of the bravest: he lasted long;\\r\\nBut on us both did haggish age steal on\\r\\nAnd wore us out of act. It much repairs me\\r\\nTo talk of your good father. In his youth\\r\\nHe had the wit which I can well observe\\r\\nTo-day in our young lords; but they may jest\\r\\nTill their own scorn return to them unnoted\\r\\nEre they can hide their levity in honour;\\r\\nSo like a courtier, contempt nor bitterness\\r\\nWere in his pride or sharpness; if they were,\\r\\nHis equal had awaked them, and his honour,\\r\\nClock to itself, knew the true minute when\\r\\nException bid him speak, and at this time\\r\\nHis tongue obey'd his hand: who were below him\\r\\nHe used as creatures of another place\\r\\nAnd bow'd his eminent top to their low ranks,\\r\\nMaking them proud of his humility,\\r\\nIn their poor praise he humbled. Such a man\\r\\nMight be a copy to these younger times;\\r\\nWhich, follow'd well, would demonstrate them now\\r\\nBut goers backward.\\r\\nBERTRAM\\r\\nHis good remembrance, sir,\\r\\nLies richer in your thoughts than on his tomb;\\r\\nSo in approof lives not his epitaph\\r\\nAs in your royal speech.\\r\\nKING\\r\\nWould I were with him! He would always say--\\r\\nMethinks I hear him now; his plausive words\\r\\nHe scatter'd not in ears, but grafted them,\\r\\nTo grow there and to bear,--'Let me not live,'--\\r\\nThis his good melancholy oft began,\\r\\nOn the catastrophe and heel of pastime,\\r\\nWhen it was out,--'Let me not live,' quoth he,\\r\\n'After my flame lacks oil, to be the snuff\\r\\nOf younger spirits, whose apprehensive senses\\r\\nAll but new things disdain; whose judgments are\\r\\nMere fathers of their garments; whose constancies\\r\\nExpire before their fashions.' This he wish'd;\\r\\nI after him do after him wish too,\\r\\nSince I nor wax nor honey can bring home,\\r\\nI quickly were dissolved from my hive,\\r\\nTo give some labourers room.\\r\\nSecond Lord\\r\\nYou are loved, sir:\\r\\nThey that least lend it you shall lack you first.\\r\\nKING\\r\\nI fill a place, I know't. How long is't, count,\\r\\nSince the physician at your father's died?\\r\\nHe was much famed.\\r\\nBERTRAM\\r\\nSome six months since, my lord.\\r\\nKING\\r\\nIf he were living, I would try him yet.\\r\\nLend me an arm; the rest have worn me out\\r\\nWith several applications; nature and sickness\\r\\nDebate it at their leisure. Welcome, count;\\r\\nMy son's no dearer.\\r\\nBERTRAM\\r\\nThank your majesty.\\r\\nExeunt. Flourish\\r\\n\\r\\nSCENE III. Rousillon. The COUNT's palace.\\r\\nEnter COUNTESS, Steward, and Clown\\r\\nCOUNTESS\\r\\nI will now hear; what say you of this gentlewoman?\\r\\nSteward\\r\\nMadam, the care I have had to even your content, I\\r\\nwish might be found in the calendar of my past\\r\\nendeavours; for then we wound our modesty and make\\r\\nfoul the clearness of our deservings, when of\\r\\nourselves we publish them.\\r\\nCOUNTESS\\r\\nWhat does this knave here? Get you gone, sirrah:\\r\\nthe complaints I have heard of you I do not all\\r\\nbelieve: 'tis my slowness that I do not; for I know\\r\\nyou lack not folly to commit them, and have ability\\r\\nenough to make such knaveries yours.\\r\\nClown\\r\\n'Tis not unknown to you, madam, I am a poor fellow.\\r\\nCOUNTESS\\r\\nWell, sir.\\r\\nClown\\r\\nNo, madam, 'tis not so well that I am poor, though\\r\\nmany of the rich are damned: but, if I may have\\r\\nyour ladyship's good will to go to the world, Isbel\\r\\nthe woman and I will do as we may.\\r\\nCOUNTESS\\r\\nWilt thou needs be a beggar?\\r\\nClown\\r\\nI do beg your good will in this case.\\r\\nCOUNTESS\\r\\nIn what case?\\r\\nClown\\r\\nIn Isbel's case and mine own.

Disdain\\r\\nRather corrupt me ever!\\r\\nKING\\r\\n'Tis only title thou disdain'st in her, the which\\r\\nI can build up.

She is young, wise, fair;\\r\\nIn these to nature she's immediate heir,\\r\\nAnd these breed honour: that is honour's scorn,\\r\\nWhich challenges itself as honour's born\\r\\nAnd is not like the sire: honours thrive,\\r\\nWhen rather from our acts we them derive\\r\\nThan our foregoers: the mere word's a slave\\r\\nDebosh'd on every tomb, on every grave\\r\\nA lying trophy, and as oft is dumb\\r\\nWhere dust and damn'd oblivion is the tomb\\r\\nOf honour'd bones indeed.

Cheque thy contempt:\\r\\nObey our will, which travails in thy good:\\r\\nBelieve not thy disdain, but presently\\r\\nDo thine own fortunes that obedient right\\r\\nWhich both thy duty owes and our power claims;\\r\\nOr I will throw thee from my care for ever\\r\\nInto the staggers and the careless lapse\\r\\nOf youth and ignorance; both my revenge and hate\\r\\nLoosing upon thee, in the name of justice,\\r\\nWithout all terms of pity. Speak; thine answer.\\r\\nBERTRAM\\r\\nPardon, my gracious lord; for I submit\\r\\nMy fancy to your eyes: when I consider\\r\\nWhat great creation and what dole of honour\\r\\nFlies where you bid it, I find that she, which late\\r\\nWas in my nobler thoughts most base, is now\\r\\nThe praised of the king; who, so ennobled,\\r\\nIs as 'twere born so.\\r\\nKING\\r\\nTake her by the hand,\\r\\nAnd tell her she is thine: to whom I promise\\r\\nA counterpoise, if not to thy estate\\r\\nA balance more replete.\\r\\nBERTRAM\\r\\nI take her hand.\\r\\nKING\\r\\nGood fortune and the favour of the king\\r\\nSmile upon this contract; whose ceremony\\r\\nShall seem expedient on the now-born brief,\\r\\nAnd be perform'd to-night: the solemn feast\\r\\nShall more attend upon the coming space,\\r\\nExpecting absent friends.

Beware of them, Diana; their promises,\\r\\nenticements, oaths, tokens, and all these engines of\\r\\nlust, are not the things they go under: many a maid\\r\\nhath been seduced by them; and the misery is,\\r\\nexample, that so terrible shows in the wreck of\\r\\nmaidenhood, cannot for all that dissuade succession,\\r\\nbut that they are limed with the twigs that threaten\\r\\nthem.

Be but your lordship\\r\\npresent at his examination: if he do not, for the\\r\\npromise of his life and in the highest compulsion of\\r\\nbase fear, offer to betray you and deliver all the\\r\\nintelligence in his power against you, and that with\\r\\nthe divine forfeit of his soul upon oath, never\\r\\ntrust my judgment in any thing.\\r\\nFirst Lord\\r\\nO, for the love of laughter, let him fetch his drum;\\r\\nhe says he has a stratagem for't: when your\\r\\nlordship sees the bottom of his success in't, and to\\r\\nwhat metal this counterfeit lump of ore will be\\r\\nmelted, if you give him not John Drum's\\r\\nentertainment, your inclining cannot be removed.\\r\\nHere he comes.\\r\\nEnter PAROLLES\\r\\n\\r\\nSecond Lord\\r\\n[Aside to BERTRAM] O, for the love of laughter,\\r\\nhinder not the honour of his design: let him fetch\\r\\noff his drum in any hand.\\r\\nBERTRAM\\r\\nHow now, monsieur! this drum sticks sorely in your\\r\\ndisposition.\\r\\nFirst Lord\\r\\nA pox on't, let it go; 'tis but a drum.\\r\\nPAROLLES\\r\\n'But a drum'! is't 'but a drum'? A drum so lost!\\r\\nThere was excellent command,--to charge in with our\\r\\nhorse upon our own wings, and to rend our own soldiers!\\r\\nFirst Lord\\r\\nThat was not to be blamed in the command of the\\r\\nservice: it was a disaster of war that Caesar\\r\\nhimself could not have prevented, if he had been\\r\\nthere to command.\\r\\nBERTRAM\\r\\nWell, we cannot greatly condemn our success: some\\r\\ndishonour we had in the loss of that drum; but it is\\r\\nnot to be recovered.\\r\\nPAROLLES\\r\\nIt might have been recovered.\\r\\nBERTRAM\\r\\nIt might; but it is not now.\\r\\nPAROLLES\\r\\nIt is to be recovered: but that the merit of\\r\\nservice is seldom attributed to the true and exact\\r\\nperformer, I would have that drum or another, or\\r\\n'hic jacet.'\\r\\nBERTRAM\\r\\nWhy, if you have a stomach, to't, monsieur: if you\\r\\nthink your mystery in stratagem can bring this\\r\\ninstrument of honour again into his native quarter,\\r\\nbe magnanimous in the enterprise and go on; I will\\r\\ngrace the attempt for a worthy exploit: if you\\r\\nspeed well in it, the duke shall both speak of it.\\r\\nand extend to you what further becomes his\\r\\ngreatness, even to the utmost syllable of your\\r\\nworthiness.\\r\\nPAROLLES\\r\\nBy the hand of a soldier, I will undertake it.\\r\\nBERTRAM\\r\\nBut you must not now slumber in it.\\r\\nPAROLLES\\r\\nI'll about it this evening: and I will presently\\r\\npen down my dilemmas, encourage myself in my\\r\\ncertainty, put myself into my mortal preparation;\\r\\nand by midnight look to hear further from me.\\r\\nBERTRAM\\r\\nMay I be bold to acquaint his grace you are gone about it?\\r\\nPAROLLES\\r\\nI know not what the success will be, my lord; but\\r\\nthe attempt I vow.\\r\\nBERTRAM\\r\\nI know thou'rt valiant; and, to the possibility of\\r\\nthy soldiership, will subscribe for thee. Farewell.\\r\\nPAROLLES\\r\\nI love not many words.\\r\\nExit\\r\\n\\r\\nSecond Lord\\r\\nNo more than a fish loves water. Is not this a\\r\\nstrange fellow, my lord, that so confidently seems\\r\\nto undertake this business, which he knows is not to\\r\\nbe done; damns himself to do and dares better be\\r\\ndamned than to do't?\\r\\nFirst Lord\\r\\nYou do not know him, my lord, as we do: certain it\\r\\nis that he will steal himself into a man's favour and\\r\\nfor a week escape a great deal of discoveries; but\\r\\nwhen you find him out, you have him ever after.\\r\\nBERTRAM\\r\\nWhy, do you think he will make no deed at all of\\r\\nthis that so seriously he does address himself unto?\\r\\nSecond Lord\\r\\nNone in the world; but return with an invention and\\r\\nclap upon you two or three probable lies: but we\\r\\nhave almost embossed him; you shall see his fall\\r\\nto-night; for indeed he is not for your lordship's respect.\\r\\nFirst Lord\\r\\nWe'll make you some sport with the fox ere we case\\r\\nhim.

Now he hath a smack of\\r\\nall neighbouring languages; therefore we must every\\r\\none be a man of his own fancy, not to know what we\\r\\nspeak one to another; so we seem to know, is to\\r\\nknow straight our purpose: choughs' language,\\r\\ngabble enough, and good enough. As for you,\\r\\ninterpreter, you must seem very politic. But couch,\\r\\nho! here he comes, to beguile two hours in a sleep,\\r\\nand then to return and swear the lies he forges.\\r\\nEnter PAROLLES\\r\\n\\r\\nPAROLLES\\r\\nTen o'clock: within these three hours 'twill be\\r\\ntime enough to go home. What shall I say I have\\r\\ndone? It must be a very plausive invention that\\r\\ncarries it: they begin to smoke me; and disgraces\\r\\nhave of late knocked too often at my door. I find\\r\\nmy tongue is too foolhardy; but my heart hath the\\r\\nfear of Mars before it and of his creatures, not\\r\\ndaring the reports of my tongue.\\r\\nSecond Lord\\r\\nThis is the first truth that e'er thine own tongue\\r\\nwas guilty of.\\r\\nPAROLLES\\r\\nWhat the devil should move me to undertake the\\r\\nrecovery of this drum, being not ignorant of the\\r\\nimpossibility, and knowing I had no such purpose? I\\r\\nmust give myself some hurts, and say I got them in\\r\\nexploit: yet slight ones will not carry it; they\\r\\nwill say, 'Came you off with so little?' and great\\r\\nones I dare not give. Wherefore, what's the\\r\\ninstance? Tongue, I must put you into a\\r\\nbutter-woman's mouth and buy myself another of\\r\\nBajazet's mule, if you prattle me into these perils.\\r\\nSecond Lord\\r\\nIs it possible he should know what he is, and be\\r\\nthat he is?\\r\\nPAROLLES\\r\\nI would the cutting of my garments would serve the\\r\\nturn, or the breaking of my Spanish sword.\\r\\nSecond Lord\\r\\nWe cannot afford you so.\\r\\nPAROLLES\\r\\nOr the baring of my beard; and to say it was in\\r\\nstratagem.\\r\\nSecond Lord\\r\\n'Twould not do.\\r\\nPAROLLES\\r\\nOr to drown my clothes, and say I was stripped.\\r\\nSecond Lord\\r\\nHardly serve.\\r\\nPAROLLES\\r\\nThough I swore I leaped from the window of the citadel.\\r\\nSecond Lord\\r\\nHow deep?\\r\\nPAROLLES\\r\\nThirty fathom.\\r\\nSecond Lord\\r\\nThree great oaths would scarce make that be believed.\\r\\nPAROLLES\\r\\nI would I had any drum of the enemy's: I would swear\\r\\nI recovered it.\\r\\nSecond Lord\\r\\nYou shall hear one anon.\\r\\nPAROLLES\\r\\nA drum now of the enemy's,--\\r\\nAlarum within\\r\\n\\r\\nSecond Lord\\r\\nThroca movousus, cargo, cargo, cargo.\\r\\nAll\\r\\nCargo, cargo, cargo, villiando par corbo, cargo.\\r\\nPAROLLES\\r\\nO, ransom, ransom! do not hide mine eyes.\\r\\nThey seize and blindfold him\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst Soldier\\r\\nBoskos thromuldo boskos.\\r\\nPAROLLES\\r\\nI know you are the Muskos' regiment:\\r\\nAnd I shall lose my life for want of language;\\r\\nIf there be here German, or Dane, low Dutch,\\r\\nItalian, or French, let him speak to me; I'll\\r\\nDiscover that which shall undo the Florentine.\\r\\nFirst Soldier\\r\\nBoskos vauvado: I understand thee, and can speak\\r\\nthy tongue.

Since Frenchmen are so braid,\\r\\nMarry that will, I live and die a maid:\\r\\nOnly in this disguise I think't no sin\\r\\nTo cozen him that would unjustly win.\\r\\nExit\\r\\n\\r\\nSCENE III. The Florentine camp.\\r\\nEnter the two French Lords and some two or three Soldiers\\r\\nFirst Lord\\r\\nYou have not given him his mother's letter?\\r\\nSecond Lord\\r\\nI have delivered it an hour since: there is\\r\\nsomething in't that stings his nature; for on the\\r\\nreading it he changed almost into another man.\\r\\nFirst Lord\\r\\nHe has much worthy blame laid upon him for shaking\\r\\noff so good a wife and so sweet a lady.\\r\\nSecond Lord\\r\\nEspecially he hath incurred the everlasting\\r\\ndispleasure of the king, who had even tuned his\\r\\nbounty to sing happiness to him. I will tell you a\\r\\nthing, but you shall let it dwell darkly with you.\\r\\nFirst Lord\\r\\nWhen you have spoken it, 'tis dead, and I am the\\r\\ngrave of it.\\r\\nSecond Lord\\r\\nHe hath perverted a young gentlewoman here in\\r\\nFlorence, of a most chaste renown; and this night he\\r\\nfleshes his will in the spoil of her honour: he hath\\r\\ngiven her his monumental ring, and thinks himself\\r\\nmade in the unchaste composition.\\r\\nFirst Lord\\r\\nNow, God delay our rebellion! as we are ourselves,\\r\\nwhat things are we!\\r\\nSecond Lord\\r\\nMerely our own traitors. And as in the common course\\r\\nof all treasons, we still see them reveal\\r\\nthemselves, till they attain to their abhorred ends,\\r\\nso he that in this action contrives against his own\\r\\nnobility, in his proper stream o'erflows himself.\\r\\nFirst Lord\\r\\nIs it not meant damnable in us, to be trumpeters of\\r\\nour unlawful intents? We shall not then have his\\r\\ncompany to-night?\\r\\nSecond Lord\\r\\nNot till after midnight; for he is dieted to his hour.\\r\\nFirst Lord\\r\\nThat approaches apace; I would gladly have him see\\r\\nhis company anatomized, that he might take a measure\\r\\nof his own judgments, wherein so curiously he had\\r\\nset this counterfeit.\\r\\nSecond Lord\\r\\nWe will not meddle with him till he come; for his\\r\\npresence must be the whip of the other.\\r\\nFirst Lord\\r\\nIn the mean time, what hear you of these wars?\\r\\nSecond Lord\\r\\nI hear there is an overture of peace.\\r\\nFirst Lord\\r\\nNay, I assure you, a peace concluded.\\r\\nSecond Lord\\r\\nWhat will Count Rousillon do then? will he travel\\r\\nhigher, or return again into France?\\r\\nFirst Lord\\r\\nI perceive, by this demand, you are not altogether\\r\\nof his council.\\r\\nSecond Lord\\r\\nLet it be forbid, sir; so should I be a great deal\\r\\nof his act.\\r\\nFirst Lord\\r\\nSir, his wife some two months since fled from his\\r\\nhouse: her pretence is a pilgrimage to Saint Jaques\\r\\nle Grand; which holy undertaking with most austere\\r\\nsanctimony she accomplished; and, there residing the\\r\\ntenderness of her nature became as a prey to her\\r\\ngrief; in fine, made a groan of her last breath, and\\r\\nnow she sings in heaven.\\r\\nSecond Lord\\r\\nHow is this justified?\\r\\nFirst Lord\\r\\nThe stronger part of it by her own letters, which\\r\\nmakes her story true, even to the point of her\\r\\ndeath: her death itself, which could not be her\\r\\noffice to say is come, was faithfully confirmed by\\r\\nthe rector of the place.\\r\\nSecond Lord\\r\\nHath the count all this intelligence?\\r\\nFirst Lord\\r\\nAy, and the particular confirmations, point from\\r\\npoint, so to the full arming of the verity.\\r\\nSecond Lord\\r\\nI am heartily sorry that he'll be glad of this.\\r\\nFirst Lord\\r\\nHow mightily sometimes we make us comforts of our losses!\\r\\nSecond Lord\\r\\nAnd how mightily some other times we drown our gain\\r\\nin tears! The great dignity that his valour hath\\r\\nhere acquired for him shall at home be encountered\\r\\nwith a shame as ample.\\r\\nFirst Lord\\r\\nThe web of our life is of a mingled yarn, good and\\r\\nill together: our virtues would be proud, if our\\r\\nfaults whipped them not; and our crimes would\\r\\ndespair, if they were not cherished by our virtues.\\r\\nEnter a Messenger\\r\\n\\r\\nHow now! where's your master?\\r\\nServant\\r\\nHe met the duke in the street, sir, of whom he hath\\r\\ntaken a solemn leave: his lordship will next\\r\\nmorning for France. The duke hath offered him\\r\\nletters of commendations to the king.\\r\\nSecond Lord\\r\\nThey shall be no more than needful there, if they\\r\\nwere more than they can commend.\\r\\nFirst Lord\\r\\nThey cannot be too sweet for the king's tartness.\\r\\nHere's his lordship now.\\r\\nEnter BERTRAM\\r\\n\\r\\nHow now, my lord! is't not after midnight?\\r\\nBERTRAM\\r\\nI have to-night dispatched sixteen businesses, a\\r\\nmonth's length a-piece, by an abstract of success:\\r\\nI have congied with the duke, done my adieu with his\\r\\nnearest; buried a wife, mourned for her; writ to my\\r\\nlady mother I am returning; entertained my convoy;\\r\\nand between these main parcels of dispatch effected\\r\\nmany nicer needs; the last was the greatest, but\\r\\nthat I have not ended yet.\\r\\nSecond Lord\\r\\nIf the business be of any difficulty, and this\\r\\nmorning your departure hence, it requires haste of\\r\\nyour lordship.\\r\\nBERTRAM\\r\\nI mean, the business is not ended, as fearing to\\r\\nhear of it hereafter. But shall we have this\\r\\ndialogue between the fool and the soldier? Come,\\r\\nbring forth this counterfeit module, he has deceived\\r\\nme, like a double-meaning prophesier.\\r\\nSecond Lord\\r\\nBring him forth: has sat i' the stocks all night,\\r\\npoor gallant knave.\\r\\nBERTRAM\\r\\nNo matter: his heels have deserved it, in usurping\\r\\nhis spurs so long. How does he carry himself?\\r\\nSecond Lord\\r\\nI have told your lordship already, the stocks carry\\r\\nhim. But to answer you as you would be understood;\\r\\nhe weeps like a wench that had shed her milk: he\\r\\nhath confessed himself to Morgan, whom he supposes\\r\\nto be a friar, from the time of his remembrance to\\r\\nthis very instant disaster of his setting i' the\\r\\nstocks: and what think you he hath confessed?\\r\\nBERTRAM\\r\\nNothing of me, has a'?\\r\\nSecond Lord\\r\\nHis confession is taken, and it shall be read to his\\r\\nface: if your lordship be in't, as I believe you\\r\\nare, you must have the patience to hear it.\\r\\nEnter PAROLLES guarded, and First Soldier\\r\\n\\r\\nBERTRAM\\r\\nA plague upon him! muffled! he can say nothing of\\r\\nme: hush, hush!\\r\\nFirst Lord\\r\\nHoodman comes! Portotartarosa\\r\\nFirst Soldier\\r\\nHe calls for the tortures: what will you say\\r\\nwithout 'em?\\r\\nPAROLLES\\r\\nI will confess what I know without constraint: if\\r\\nye pinch me like a pasty, I can say no more.\\r\\nFirst Soldier\\r\\nBosko chimurcho.\\r\\nFirst Lord\\r\\nBoblibindo chicurmurco.\\r\\nFirst Soldier\\r\\nYou are a merciful general.

What say you to that?\\r\\nPAROLLES\\r\\nFive or six thousand; but very weak and\\r\\nunserviceable: the troops are all scattered, and\\r\\nthe commanders very poor rogues, upon my reputation\\r\\nand credit and as I hope to live.\\r\\nFirst Soldier\\r\\nShall I set down your answer so?\\r\\nPAROLLES\\r\\nDo: I'll take the sacrament on't, how and which way you will.\\r\\nBERTRAM\\r\\nAll's one to him. What a past-saving slave is this!\\r\\nFirst Lord\\r\\nYou're deceived, my lord: this is Monsieur\\r\\nParolles, the gallant militarist,--that was his own\\r\\nphrase,--that had the whole theoric of war in the\\r\\nknot of his scarf, and the practise in the chape of\\r\\nhis dagger.\\r\\nSecond Lord\\r\\nI will never trust a man again for keeping his sword\\r\\nclean. nor believe he can have every thing in him\\r\\nby wearing his apparel neatly.\\r\\nFirst Soldier\\r\\nWell, that's set down.\\r\\nPAROLLES\\r\\nFive or six thousand horse, I said,-- I will say\\r\\ntrue,--or thereabouts, set down, for I'll speak truth.\\r\\nFirst Lord\\r\\nHe's very near the truth in this.\\r\\nBERTRAM\\r\\nBut I con him no thanks for't, in the nature he\\r\\ndelivers it.\\r\\nPAROLLES\\r\\nPoor rogues, I pray you, say.\\r\\nFirst Soldier\\r\\nWell, that's set down.\\r\\nPAROLLES\\r\\nI humbly thank you, sir: a truth's a truth, the\\r\\nrogues are marvellous poor.\\r\\nFirst Soldier\\r\\n[Reads] 'Demand of him, of what strength they are\\r\\na-foot.' What say you to that?\\r\\nPAROLLES\\r\\nBy my troth, sir, if I were to live this present\\r\\nhour, I will tell true. Let me see: Spurio, a\\r\\nhundred and fifty; Sebastian, so many; Corambus, so\\r\\nmany; Jaques, so many; Guiltian, Cosmo, Lodowick,\\r\\nand Gratii, two hundred and fifty each; mine own\\r\\ncompany, Chitopher, Vaumond, Bentii, two hundred and\\r\\nfifty each: so that the muster-file, rotten and\\r\\nsound, upon my life, amounts not to fifteen thousand\\r\\npoll; half of the which dare not shake snow from off\\r\\ntheir cassocks, lest they shake themselves to pieces.\\r\\nBERTRAM\\r\\nWhat shall be done to him?\\r\\nFirst Lord\\r\\nNothing, but let him have thanks. Demand of him my\\r\\ncondition, and what credit I have with the duke.\\r\\nFirst Soldier\\r\\nWell, that's set down.\\r\\nReads\\r\\n\\r\\n'You shall demand of him, whether one Captain Dumain\\r\\nbe i' the camp, a Frenchman; what his reputation is\\r\\nwith the duke; what his valour, honesty, and\\r\\nexpertness in wars; or whether he thinks it were not\\r\\npossible, with well-weighing sums of gold, to\\r\\ncorrupt him to revolt.'

If she had partaken of my\\r\\nflesh, and cost me the dearest groans of a mother, I\\r\\ncould not have owed her a more rooted love.\\r\\nLAFEU\\r\\n'Twas a good lady, 'twas a good lady: we may pick a\\r\\nthousand salads ere we light on such another herb.\\r\\nClown\\r\\nIndeed, sir, she was the sweet marjoram of the\\r\\nsalad, or rather, the herb of grace.\\r\\nLAFEU\\r\\nThey are not herbs, you knave; they are nose-herbs.\\r\\nClown\\r\\nI am no great Nebuchadnezzar, sir; I have not much\\r\\nskill in grass.\\r\\nLAFEU\\r\\nWhether dost thou profess thyself, a knave or a fool?\\r\\nClown\\r\\nA fool, sir, at a woman's service, and a knave at a man's.\\r\\nLAFEU\\r\\nYour distinction?\\r\\nClown\\r\\nI would cozen the man of his wife and do his service.\\r\\nLAFEU\\r\\nSo you were a knave at his service, indeed.\\r\\nClown\\r\\nAnd I would give his wife my bauble, sir, to do her service.\\r\\nLAFEU\\r\\nI will subscribe for thee, thou art both knave and fool.\\r\\nClown\\r\\nAt your service.\\r\\nLAFEU\\r\\nNo, no, no.\\r\\nClown\\r\\nWhy, sir, if I cannot serve you, I can serve as\\r\\ngreat a prince as you are.\\r\\nLAFEU\\r\\nWho's that? a Frenchman?\\r\\nClown\\r\\nFaith, sir, a' has an English name; but his fisnomy\\r\\nis more hotter in France than there.\\r\\nLAFEU\\r\\nWhat prince is that?\\r\\nClown\\r\\nThe black prince, sir; alias, the prince of\\r\\ndarkness; alias, the devil.\\r\\nLAFEU\\r\\nHold thee, there's my purse: I give thee not this\\r\\nto suggest thee from thy master thou talkest of;\\r\\nserve him still.\\r\\nClown\\r\\nI am a woodland fellow, sir, that always loved a\\r\\ngreat fire; and the master I speak of ever keeps a\\r\\ngood fire.

And I was about to\\r\\ntell you, since I heard of the good lady's death and\\r\\nthat my lord your son was upon his return home, I\\r\\nmoved the king my master to speak in the behalf of\\r\\nmy daughter; which, in the minority of them both,\\r\\nhis majesty, out of a self-gracious remembrance, did\\r\\nfirst propose: his highness hath promised me to do\\r\\nit: and, to stop up the displeasure he hath\\r\\nconceived against your son, there is no fitter\\r\\nmatter.

Then, if you know\\r\\nThat you are well acquainted with yourself,\\r\\nConfess 'twas hers, and by what rough enforcement\\r\\nYou got it from her: she call'd the saints to surety\\r\\nThat she would never put it from her finger,\\r\\nUnless she gave it to yourself in bed,\\r\\nWhere you have never come, or sent it us\\r\\nUpon her great disaster.\\r\\nBERTRAM\\r\\nShe never saw it.\\r\\nKING\\r\\nThou speak'st it falsely, as I love mine honour;\\r\\nAnd makest conjectural fears to come into me\\r\\nWhich I would fain shut out. If it should prove\\r\\nThat thou art so inhuman,--'twill not prove so;--\\r\\nAnd yet I know not: thou didst hate her deadly,\\r\\nAnd she is dead; which nothing, but to close\\r\\nHer eyes myself, could win me to believe,\\r\\nMore than to see this ring.

Orchard of Oliver's house.\\r\\nEnter ORLANDO and ADAM\\r\\nORLANDO\\r\\nAs I remember, Adam, it was upon this fashion\\r\\nbequeathed me by will but poor a thousand crowns,\\r\\nand, as thou sayest, charged my brother, on his\\r\\nblessing, to breed me well: and there begins my\\r\\nsadness. My brother Jaques he keeps at school, and\\r\\nreport speaks goldenly of his profit: for my part,\\r\\nhe keeps me rustically at home, or, to speak more\\r\\nproperly, stays me here at home unkept; for call you\\r\\nthat keeping for a gentleman of my birth, that\\r\\ndiffers not from the stalling of an ox? His horses\\r\\nare bred better; for, besides that they are fair\\r\\nwith their feeding, they are taught their manage,\\r\\nand to that end riders dearly hired: but I, his\\r\\nbrother, gain nothing under him but growth; for the\\r\\nwhich his animals on his dunghills are as much\\r\\nbound to him as I. Besides this nothing that he so\\r\\nplentifully gives me, the something that nature gave\\r\\nme his countenance seems to take from me: he lets\\r\\nme feed with his hinds, bars me the place of a\\r\\nbrother, and, as much as in him lies, mines my\\r\\ngentility with my education. This is it, Adam, that\\r\\ngrieves me; and the spirit of my father, which I\\r\\nthink is within me, begins to mutiny against this\\r\\nservitude: I will no longer endure it, though yet I\\r\\nknow no wise remedy how to avoid it.\\r\\nADAM\\r\\nYonder comes my master, your brother.\\r\\nORLANDO\\r\\nGo apart, Adam, and thou shalt hear how he will\\r\\nshake me up.\\r\\nEnter OLIVER\\r\\n\\r\\nOLIVER\\r\\nNow, sir! what make you here?\\r\\nORLANDO\\r\\nNothing: I am not taught to make any thing.\\r\\nOLIVER\\r\\nWhat mar you then, sir?\\r\\nORLANDO\\r\\nMarry, sir, I am helping you to mar that which God\\r\\nmade, a poor unworthy brother of yours, with idleness.\\r\\nOLIVER\\r\\nMarry, sir, be better employed, and be naught awhile.\\r\\nORLANDO\\r\\nShall I keep your hogs and eat husks with them?\\r\\nWhat prodigal portion have I spent, that I should\\r\\ncome to such penury?\\r\\nOLIVER\\r\\nKnow you where your are, sir?\\r\\nORLANDO\\r\\nO, sir, very well; here in your orchard.\\r\\nOLIVER\\r\\nKnow you before whom, sir?\\r\\nORLANDO\\r\\nAy, better than him I am before knows me. I know\\r\\nyou are my eldest brother; and, in the gentle\\r\\ncondition of blood, you should so know me. The\\r\\ncourtesy of nations allows you my better, in that\\r\\nyou are the first-born; but the same tradition\\r\\ntakes not away my blood, were there twenty brothers\\r\\nbetwixt us: I have as much of my father in me as\\r\\nyou; albeit, I confess, your coming before me is\\r\\nnearer to his reverence.\\r\\nOLIVER\\r\\nWhat, boy!\\r\\nORLANDO\\r\\nCome, come, elder brother, you are too young in this.\\r\\nOLIVER\\r\\nWilt thou lay hands on me, villain?\\r\\nORLANDO\\r\\nI am no villain; I am the youngest son of Sir\\r\\nRowland de Boys; he was my father, and he is thrice\\r\\na villain that says such a father begot villains.\\r\\nWert thou not my brother, I would not take this hand\\r\\nfrom thy throat till this other had pulled out thy\\r\\ntongue for saying so: thou hast railed on thyself.\\r\\nADAM\\r\\nSweet masters, be patient: for your father's\\r\\nremembrance, be at accord.\\r\\nOLIVER\\r\\nLet me go, I say.\\r\\nORLANDO\\r\\nI will not, till I please: you shall hear me. My\\r\\nfather charged you in his will to give me good\\r\\neducation: you have trained me like a peasant,\\r\\nobscuring and hiding from me all gentleman-like\\r\\nqualities. The spirit of my father grows strong in\\r\\nme, and I will no longer endure it: therefore allow\\r\\nme such exercises as may become a gentleman, or\\r\\ngive me the poor allottery my father left me by\\r\\ntestament; with that I will go buy my fortunes.\\r\\nOLIVER\\r\\nAnd what wilt thou do? beg, when that is spent?\\r\\nWell, sir, get you in: I will not long be troubled\\r\\nwith you; you shall have some part of your will: I\\r\\npray you, leave me.\\r\\nORLANDO\\r\\nI will no further offend you than becomes me for my good.\\r\\nOLIVER\\r\\nGet you with him, you old dog.\\r\\nADAM\\r\\nIs 'old dog' my reward? Most true, I have lost my\\r\\nteeth in your service. God be with my old master!\\r\\nhe would not have spoke such a word.\\r\\nExeunt ORLANDO and ADAM\\r\\n\\r\\nOLIVER\\r\\nIs it even so? begin you to grow upon me?

She is at the court, and no\\r\\nless beloved of her uncle than his own daughter; and\\r\\nnever two ladies loved as they do.\\r\\nOLIVER\\r\\nWhere will the old duke live?\\r\\nCHARLES\\r\\nThey say he is already in the forest of Arden, and\\r\\na many merry men with him; and there they live like\\r\\nthe old Robin Hood of England: they say many young\\r\\ngentlemen flock to him every day, and fleet the time\\r\\ncarelessly, as they did in the golden world.\\r\\nOLIVER\\r\\nWhat, you wrestle to-morrow before the new duke?\\r\\nCHARLES\\r\\nMarry, do I, sir; and I came to acquaint you with a\\r\\nmatter. I am given, sir, secretly to understand\\r\\nthat your younger brother Orlando hath a disposition\\r\\nto come in disguised against me to try a fall.\\r\\nTo-morrow, sir, I wrestle for my credit; and he that\\r\\nescapes me without some broken limb shall acquit him\\r\\nwell. Your brother is but young and tender; and,\\r\\nfor your love, I would be loath to foil him, as I\\r\\nmust, for my own honour, if he come in: therefore,\\r\\nout of my love to you, I came hither to acquaint you\\r\\nwithal, that either you might stay him from his\\r\\nintendment or brook such disgrace well as he shall\\r\\nrun into, in that it is a thing of his own search\\r\\nand altogether against my will.\\r\\nOLIVER\\r\\nCharles, I thank thee for thy love to me, which\\r\\nthou shalt find I will most kindly requite. I had\\r\\nmyself notice of my brother's purpose herein and\\r\\nhave by underhand means laboured to dissuade him from\\r\\nit, but he is resolute. I'll tell thee, Charles:\\r\\nit is the stubbornest young fellow of France, full\\r\\nof ambition, an envious emulator of every man's\\r\\ngood parts, a secret and villanous contriver against\\r\\nme his natural brother: therefore use thy\\r\\ndiscretion; I had as lief thou didst break his neck\\r\\nas his finger. And thou wert best look to't; for if\\r\\nthou dost him any slight disgrace or if he do not\\r\\nmightily grace himself on thee, he will practise\\r\\nagainst thee by poison, entrap thee by some\\r\\ntreacherous device and never leave thee till he\\r\\nhath ta'en thy life by some indirect means or other;\\r\\nfor, I assure thee, and almost with tears I speak\\r\\nit, there is not one so young and so villanous this\\r\\nday living. I speak but brotherly of him; but\\r\\nshould I anatomize him to thee as he is, I must\\r\\nblush and weep and thou must look pale and wonder.\\r\\nCHARLES\\r\\nI am heartily glad I came hither to you. If he come\\r\\nto-morrow, I'll give him his payment: if ever he go\\r\\nalone again, I'll never wrestle for prize more: and\\r\\nso God keep your worship!\\r\\nOLIVER\\r\\nFarewell, good Charles.\\r\\nExit CHARLES\\r\\n\\r\\nNow will I stir this gamester: I hope I shall see\\r\\nan end of him; for my soul, yet I know not why,\\r\\nhates nothing more than he. Yet he's gentle, never\\r\\nschooled and yet learned, full of noble device, of\\r\\nall sorts enchantingly beloved, and indeed so much\\r\\nin the heart of the world, and especially of my own\\r\\npeople, who best know him, that I am altogether\\r\\nmisprised: but it shall not be so long; this\\r\\nwrestler shall clear all: nothing remains but that\\r\\nI kindle the boy thither; which now I'll go about.\\r\\nExit\\r\\n\\r\\nSCENE II. Lawn before the Duke's palace.\\r\\nEnter CELIA and ROSALIND\\r\\nCELIA\\r\\nI pray thee, Rosalind, sweet my coz, be merry.\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nDear Celia, I show more mirth than I am mistress of;\\r\\nand would you yet I were merrier?

If my uncle, thy banished father,\\r\\nhad banished thy uncle, the duke my father, so thou\\r\\nhadst been still with me, I could have taught my\\r\\nlove to take thy father for mine: so wouldst thou,\\r\\nif the truth of thy love to me were so righteously\\r\\ntempered as mine is to thee.\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nWell, I will forget the condition of my estate, to\\r\\nrejoice in yours.\\r\\nCELIA\\r\\nYou know my father hath no child but I, nor none is\\r\\nlike to have: and, truly, when he dies, thou shalt\\r\\nbe his heir, for what he hath taken away from thy\\r\\nfather perforce, I will render thee again in\\r\\naffection; by mine honour, I will; and when I break\\r\\nthat oath, let me turn monster: therefore, my\\r\\nsweet Rose, my dear Rose, be merry.\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nFrom henceforth I will, coz, and devise sports. Let\\r\\nme see; what think you of falling in love?\\r\\nCELIA\\r\\nMarry, I prithee, do, to make sport withal: but\\r\\nlove no man in good earnest; nor no further in sport\\r\\nneither than with safety of a pure blush thou mayst\\r\\nin honour come off again.\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nWhat shall be our sport, then?\\r\\nCELIA\\r\\nLet us sit and mock the good housewife Fortune from\\r\\nher wheel, that her gifts may henceforth be bestowed equally.\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nI would we could do so, for her benefits are\\r\\nmightily misplaced, and the bountiful blind woman\\r\\ndoth most mistake in her gifts to women.\\r\\nCELIA\\r\\n'Tis true; for those that she makes fair she scarce\\r\\nmakes honest, and those that she makes honest she\\r\\nmakes very ill-favouredly.\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nNay, now thou goest from Fortune's office to\\r\\nNature's: Fortune reigns in gifts of the world,\\r\\nnot in the lineaments of Nature.\\r\\nEnter TOUCHSTONE\\r\\n\\r\\nCELIA\\r\\nNo? when Nature hath made a fair creature, may she\\r\\nnot by Fortune fall into the fire? Though Nature\\r\\nhath given us wit to flout at Fortune, hath not\\r\\nFortune sent in this fool to cut off the argument?\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nIndeed, there is Fortune too hard for Nature, when\\r\\nFortune makes Nature's natural the cutter-off of\\r\\nNature's wit.\\r\\nCELIA\\r\\nPeradventure this is not Fortune's work neither, but\\r\\nNature's; who perceiveth our natural wits too dull\\r\\nto reason of such goddesses and hath sent this\\r\\nnatural for our whetstone; for always the dulness of\\r\\nthe fool is the whetstone of the wits. How now,\\r\\nwit! whither wander you?\\r\\nTOUCHSTONE\\r\\nMistress, you must come away to your father.\\r\\nCELIA\\r\\nWere you made the messenger?\\r\\nTOUCHSTONE\\r\\nNo, by mine honour, but I was bid to come for you.\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nWhere learned you that oath, fool?\\r\\nTOUCHSTONE\\r\\nOf a certain knight that swore by his honour they\\r\\nwere good pancakes and swore by his honour the\\r\\nmustard was naught: now I'll stand to it, the\\r\\npancakes were naught and the mustard was good, and\\r\\nyet was not the knight forsworn.\\r\\nCELIA\\r\\nHow prove you that, in the great heap of your\\r\\nknowledge?\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nAy, marry, now unmuzzle your wisdom.\\r\\nTOUCHSTONE\\r\\nStand you both forth now: stroke your chins, and\\r\\nswear by your beards that I am a knave.\\r\\nCELIA\\r\\nBy our beards, if we had them, thou art.\\r\\nTOUCHSTONE\\r\\nBy my knavery, if I had it, then I were; but if you\\r\\nswear by that that is not, you are not forsworn: no\\r\\nmore was this knight swearing by his honour, for he\\r\\nnever had any; or if he had, he had sworn it away\\r\\nbefore ever he saw those pancakes or that mustard.\\r\\nCELIA\\r\\nPrithee, who is't that thou meanest?\\r\\nTOUCHSTONE\\r\\nOne that old Frederick, your father, loves.\\r\\nCELIA\\r\\nMy father's love is enough to honour him: enough!\\r\\nspeak no more of him; you'll be whipped for taxation\\r\\none of these days.\\r\\nTOUCHSTONE\\r\\nThe more pity, that fools may not speak wisely what\\r\\nwise men do foolishly.\\r\\nCELIA\\r\\nBy my troth, thou sayest true; for since the little\\r\\nwit that fools have was silenced, the little foolery\\r\\nthat wise men have makes a great show. Here comes\\r\\nMonsieur Le Beau.\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nWith his mouth full of news.\\r\\nCELIA\\r\\nWhich he will put on us, as pigeons feed their young.\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nThen shall we be news-crammed.\\r\\nCELIA\\r\\nAll the better; we shall be the more marketable.\\r\\nEnter LE BEAU\\r\\n\\r\\nBon jour, Monsieur Le Beau: what's the news?\\r\\nLE BEAU\\r\\nFair princess, you have lost much good sport.\\r\\nCELIA\\r\\nSport! of what colour?\\r\\nLE BEAU\\r\\nWhat colour, madam! how shall I answer you?\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nAs wit and fortune will.\\r\\nTOUCHSTONE\\r\\nOr as the Destinies decree.\\r\\nCELIA\\r\\nWell said: that was laid on with a trowel.\\r\\nTOUCHSTONE\\r\\nNay, if I keep not my rank,--\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nThou losest thy old smell.\\r\\nLE BEAU\\r\\nYou amaze me, ladies: I would have told you of good\\r\\nwrestling, which you have lost the sight of.\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nYou tell us the manner of the wrestling.\\r\\nLE BEAU\\r\\nI will tell you the beginning; and, if it please\\r\\nyour ladyships, you may see the end; for the best is\\r\\nyet to do; and here, where you are, they are coming\\r\\nto perform it.\\r\\nCELIA\\r\\nWell, the beginning, that is dead and buried.\\r\\nLE BEAU\\r\\nThere comes an old man and his three sons,--\\r\\nCELIA\\r\\nI could match this beginning with an old tale.\\r\\nLE BEAU\\r\\nThree proper young men, of excellent growth and presence.\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nWith bills on their necks, 'Be it known unto all men\\r\\nby these presents.'\\r\\nLE BEAU\\r\\nThe eldest of the three wrestled with Charles, the\\r\\nduke's wrestler; which Charles in a moment threw him\\r\\nand broke three of his ribs, that there is little\\r\\nhope of life in him: so he served the second, and\\r\\nso the third. Yonder they lie; the poor old man,\\r\\ntheir father, making such pitiful dole over them\\r\\nthat all the beholders take his part with weeping.\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nAlas!\\r\\nTOUCHSTONE\\r\\nBut what is the sport, monsieur, that the ladies\\r\\nhave lost?\\r\\nLE BEAU\\r\\nWhy, this that I speak of.\\r\\nTOUCHSTONE\\r\\nThus men may grow wiser every day: it is the first\\r\\ntime that ever I heard breaking of ribs was sport\\r\\nfor ladies.\\r\\nCELIA\\r\\nOr I, I promise thee.\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nBut is there any else longs to see this broken music\\r\\nin his sides? is there yet another dotes upon\\r\\nrib-breaking? Shall we see this wrestling, cousin?\\r\\nLE BEAU\\r\\nYou must, if you stay here; for here is the place\\r\\nappointed for the wrestling, and they are ready to\\r\\nperform it.\\r\\nCELIA\\r\\nYonder, sure, they are coming: let us now stay and see it.\\r\\nFlourish. Enter DUKE FREDERICK, Lords, ORLANDO, CHARLES, and Attendants\\r\\n\\r\\nDUKE FREDERICK\\r\\nCome on: since the youth will not be entreated, his\\r\\nown peril on his forwardness.\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nIs yonder the man?\\r\\nLE BEAU\\r\\nEven he, madam.\\r\\nCELIA\\r\\nAlas, he is too young! yet he looks successfully.\\r\\nDUKE FREDERICK\\r\\nHow now, daughter and cousin! are you crept hither\\r\\nto see the wrestling?\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nAy, my liege, so please you give us leave.\\r\\nDUKE FREDERICK\\r\\nYou will take little delight in it, I can tell you;\\r\\nthere is such odds in the man. In pity of the\\r\\nchallenger's youth I would fain dissuade him, but he\\r\\nwill not be entreated. Speak to him, ladies; see if\\r\\nyou can move him.\\r\\nCELIA\\r\\nCall him hither, good Monsieur Le Beau.\\r\\nDUKE FREDERICK\\r\\nDo so: I'll not be by.\\r\\nLE BEAU\\r\\nMonsieur the challenger, the princesses call for you.\\r\\nORLANDO\\r\\nI attend them with all respect and duty.\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nYoung man, have you challenged Charles the wrestler?\\r\\nORLANDO\\r\\nNo, fair princess; he is the general challenger: I\\r\\ncome but in, as others do, to try with him the\\r\\nstrength of my youth.\\r\\nCELIA\\r\\nYoung gentleman, your spirits are too bold for your\\r\\nyears. You have seen cruel proof of this man's\\r\\nstrength: if you saw yourself with your eyes or\\r\\nknew yourself with your judgment, the fear of your\\r\\nadventure would counsel you to a more equal\\r\\nenterprise. We pray you, for your own sake, to\\r\\nembrace your own safety and give over this attempt.\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nDo, young sir; your reputation shall not therefore\\r\\nbe misprised: we will make it our suit to the duke\\r\\nthat the wrestling might not go forward.\\r\\nORLANDO\\r\\nI beseech you, punish me not with your hard\\r\\nthoughts; wherein I confess me much guilty, to deny\\r\\nso fair and excellent ladies any thing. But let\\r\\nyour fair eyes and gentle wishes go with me to my\\r\\ntrial: wherein if I be foiled, there is but one\\r\\nshamed that was never gracious; if killed, but one\\r\\ndead that was willing to be so: I shall do my\\r\\nfriends no wrong, for I have none to lament me, the\\r\\nworld no injury, for in it I have nothing; only in\\r\\nthe world I fill up a place, which may be better\\r\\nsupplied when I have made it empty.\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nThe little strength that I have, I would it were with you.\\r\\nCELIA\\r\\nAnd mine, to eke out hers.\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nFare you well: pray heaven I be deceived in you!\\r\\nCELIA\\r\\nYour heart's desires be with you!\\r\\nCHARLES\\r\\nCome, where is this young gallant that is so\\r\\ndesirous to lie with his mother earth?\\r\\nORLANDO\\r\\nReady, sir; but his will hath in it a more modest working.\\r\\nDUKE FREDERICK\\r\\nYou shall try but one fall.\\r\\nCHARLES\\r\\nNo, I warrant your grace, you shall not entreat him\\r\\nto a second, that have so mightily persuaded him\\r\\nfrom a first.\\r\\nORLANDO\\r\\nAn you mean to mock me after, you should not have\\r\\nmocked me before: but come your ways.\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nNow Hercules be thy speed, young man!\\r\\nCELIA\\r\\nI would I were invisible, to catch the strong\\r\\nfellow by the leg.\\r\\nThey wrestle\\r\\n\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nO excellent young man!\\r\\nCELIA\\r\\nIf I had a thunderbolt in mine eye, I can tell who\\r\\nshould down.\\r\\nShout. CHARLES is thrown\\r\\n\\r\\nDUKE FREDERICK\\r\\nNo more, no more.\\r\\nORLANDO\\r\\nYes, I beseech your grace: I am not yet well breathed.\\r\\nDUKE FREDERICK\\r\\nHow dost thou, Charles?\\r\\nLE BEAU\\r\\nHe cannot speak, my lord.\\r\\nDUKE FREDERICK\\r\\nBear him away. What is thy name, young man?\\r\\nORLANDO\\r\\nOrlando, my liege; the youngest son of Sir Rowland de Boys.\\r\\nDUKE FREDERICK\\r\\nI would thou hadst been son to some man else:\\r\\nThe world esteem'd thy father honourable,\\r\\nBut I did find him still mine enemy:\\r\\nThou shouldst have better pleased me with this deed,\\r\\nHadst thou descended from another house.\\r\\nBut fare thee well; thou art a gallant youth:\\r\\nI would thou hadst told me of another father.\\r\\nExeunt DUKE FREDERICK, train, and LE BEAU\\r\\n\\r\\nCELIA\\r\\nWere I my father, coz, would I do this?\\r\\nORLANDO\\r\\nI am more proud to be Sir Rowland's son,\\r\\nHis youngest son; and would not change that calling,\\r\\nTo be adopted heir to Frederick.\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nMy father loved Sir Rowland as his soul,\\r\\nAnd all the world was of my father's mind:\\r\\nHad I before known this young man his son,\\r\\nI should have given him tears unto entreaties,\\r\\nEre he should thus have ventured.\\r\\nCELIA\\r\\nGentle cousin,\\r\\nLet us go thank him and encourage him:\\r\\nMy father's rough and envious disposition\\r\\nSticks me at heart. Sir, you have well deserved:\\r\\nIf you do keep your promises in love\\r\\nBut justly, as you have exceeded all promise,\\r\\nYour mistress shall be happy.\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nGentleman,\\r\\nGiving him a chain from her neck\\r\\n\\r\\nWear this for me, one out of suits with fortune,\\r\\nThat could give more, but that her hand lacks means.\\r\\nShall we go, coz?\\r\\nCELIA\\r\\nAy. Fare you well, fair gentleman.\\r\\nORLANDO\\r\\nCan I not say, I thank you? My better parts\\r\\nAre all thrown down, and that which here stands up\\r\\nIs but a quintain, a mere lifeless block.\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nHe calls us back: my pride fell with my fortunes;\\r\\nI'll ask him what he would. Did you call, sir?\\r\\nSir, you have wrestled well and overthrown\\r\\nMore than your enemies.\\r\\nCELIA\\r\\nWill you go, coz?\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nHave with you. Fare you well.\\r\\nExeunt ROSALIND and CELIA\\r\\n\\r\\nORLANDO\\r\\nWhat passion hangs these weights upon my tongue?\\r\\nI cannot speak to her, yet she urged conference.\\r\\nO poor Orlando, thou art overthrown!\\r\\nOr Charles or something weaker masters thee.\\r\\nRe-enter LE BEAU\\r\\n\\r\\nLE BEAU\\r\\nGood sir, I do in friendship counsel you\\r\\nTo leave this place. Albeit you have deserved\\r\\nHigh commendation, true applause and love,\\r\\nYet such is now the duke's condition\\r\\nThat he misconstrues all that you have done.\\r\\nThe duke is humorous; what he is indeed,\\r\\nMore suits you to conceive than I to speak of.\\r\\nORLANDO\\r\\nI thank you, sir: and, pray you, tell me this:\\r\\nWhich of the two was daughter of the duke\\r\\nThat here was at the wrestling?\\r\\nLE BEAU\\r\\nNeither his daughter, if we judge by manners;\\r\\nBut yet indeed the lesser is his daughter\\r\\nThe other is daughter to the banish'd duke,\\r\\nAnd here detain'd by her usurping uncle,\\r\\nTo keep his daughter company; whose loves\\r\\nAre dearer than the natural bond of sisters.\\r\\nBut I can tell you that of late this duke\\r\\nHath ta'en displeasure 'gainst his gentle niece,\\r\\nGrounded upon no other argument\\r\\nBut that the people praise her for her virtues\\r\\nAnd pity her for her good father's sake;\\r\\nAnd, on my life, his malice 'gainst the lady\\r\\nWill suddenly break forth. Sir, fare you well:\\r\\nHereafter, in a better world than this,\\r\\nI shall desire more love and knowledge of you.\\r\\nORLANDO\\r\\nI rest much bounden to you: fare you well.\\r\\nExit LE BEAU\\r\\n\\r\\nThus must I from the smoke into the smother;\\r\\nFrom tyrant duke unto a tyrant brother:\\r\\nBut heavenly Rosalind!\\r\\nExit\\r\\n\\r\\nSCENE III. A room in the palace.\\r\\nEnter CELIA and ROSALIND\\r\\nCELIA\\r\\nWhy, cousin! why, Rosalind! Cupid have mercy! not a word?\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nNot one to throw at a dog.\\r\\nCELIA\\r\\nNo, thy words are too precious to be cast away upon\\r\\ncurs; throw some of them at me; come, lame me with reasons.\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nThen there were two cousins laid up; when the one\\r\\nshould be lamed with reasons and the other mad\\r\\nwithout any.\\r\\nCELIA\\r\\nBut is all this for your father?\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nNo, some of it is for my child's father. O, how\\r\\nfull of briers is this working-day world!\\r\\nCELIA\\r\\nThey are but burs, cousin, thrown upon thee in\\r\\nholiday foolery: if we walk not in the trodden\\r\\npaths our very petticoats will catch them.\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nI could shake them off my coat: these burs are in my heart.\\r\\nCELIA\\r\\nHem them away.\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nI would try, if I could cry 'hem' and have him.\\r\\nCELIA\\r\\nCome, come, wrestle with thy affections.\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nO, they take the part of a better wrestler than myself!\\r\\nCELIA\\r\\nO, a good wish upon you! you will try in time, in\\r\\ndespite of a fall. But, turning these jests out of\\r\\nservice, let us talk in good earnest: is it\\r\\npossible, on such a sudden, you should fall into so\\r\\nstrong a liking with old Sir Rowland's youngest son?\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nThe duke my father loved his father dearly.\\r\\nCELIA\\r\\nDoth it therefore ensue that you should love his son\\r\\ndearly? By this kind of chase, I should hate him,\\r\\nfor my father hated his father dearly; yet I hate\\r\\nnot Orlando.\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nNo, faith, hate him not, for my sake.\\r\\nCELIA\\r\\nWhy should I not? doth he not deserve well?\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nLet me love him for that, and do you love him\\r\\nbecause I do. Look, here comes the duke.\\r\\nCELIA\\r\\nWith his eyes full of anger.\\r\\nEnter DUKE FREDERICK, with Lords\\r\\n\\r\\nDUKE FREDERICK\\r\\nMistress, dispatch you with your safest haste\\r\\nAnd get you from our court.\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nMe, uncle?\\r\\nDUKE FREDERICK\\r\\nYou, cousin\\r\\nWithin these ten days if that thou be'st found\\r\\nSo near our public court as twenty miles,\\r\\nThou diest for it.\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nI do beseech your grace,\\r\\nLet me the knowledge of my fault bear with me:\\r\\nIf with myself I hold intelligence\\r\\nOr have acquaintance with mine own desires,\\r\\nIf that I do not dream or be not frantic,--\\r\\nAs I do trust I am not--then, dear uncle,\\r\\nNever so much as in a thought unborn\\r\\nDid I offend your highness.\\r\\nDUKE FREDERICK\\r\\nThus do all traitors:\\r\\nIf their purgation did consist in words,\\r\\nThey are as innocent as grace itself:\\r\\nLet it suffice thee that I trust thee not.\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nYet your mistrust cannot make me a traitor:\\r\\nTell me whereon the likelihood depends.\\r\\nDUKE FREDERICK\\r\\nThou art thy father's daughter; there's enough.\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nSo was I when your highness took his dukedom;\\r\\nSo was I when your highness banish'd him:\\r\\nTreason is not inherited, my lord;\\r\\nOr, if we did derive it from our friends,\\r\\nWhat's that to me? my father was no traitor:\\r\\nThen, good my liege, mistake me not so much\\r\\nTo think my poverty is treacherous.\\r\\nCELIA\\r\\nDear sovereign, hear me speak.\\r\\nDUKE FREDERICK\\r\\nAy, Celia; we stay'd her for your sake,\\r\\nElse had she with her father ranged along.\\r\\nCELIA\\r\\nI did not then entreat to have her stay;\\r\\nIt was your pleasure and your own remorse:\\r\\nI was too young that time to value her;\\r\\nBut now I know her: if she be a traitor,\\r\\nWhy so am I; we still have slept together,\\r\\nRose at an instant, learn'd, play'd, eat together,\\r\\nAnd wheresoever we went, like Juno's swans,\\r\\nStill we went coupled and inseparable.\\r\\nDUKE FREDERICK\\r\\nShe is too subtle for thee; and her smoothness,\\r\\nHer very silence and her patience\\r\\nSpeak to the people, and they pity her.\\r\\nThou art a fool: she robs thee of thy name;\\r\\nAnd thou wilt show more bright and seem more virtuous\\r\\nWhen she is gone. Then open not thy lips:\\r\\nFirm and irrevocable is my doom\\r\\nWhich I have pass'd upon her; she is banish'd.\\r\\nCELIA\\r\\nPronounce that sentence then on me, my liege:\\r\\nI cannot live out of her company.\\r\\nDUKE FREDERICK\\r\\nYou are a fool. You, niece, provide yourself:\\r\\nIf you outstay the time, upon mine honour,\\r\\nAnd in the greatness of my word, you die.\\r\\nExeunt DUKE FREDERICK and Lords\\r\\n\\r\\nCELIA\\r\\nO my poor Rosalind, whither wilt thou go?\\r\\nWilt thou change fathers?

Rosalind lacks then the love\\r\\nWhich teacheth thee that thou and I am one:\\r\\nShall we be sunder'd? shall we part, sweet girl?\\r\\nNo: let my father seek another heir.\\r\\nTherefore devise with me how we may fly,\\r\\nWhither to go and what to bear with us;\\r\\nAnd do not seek to take your change upon you,\\r\\nTo bear your griefs yourself and leave me out;\\r\\nFor, by this heaven, now at our sorrows pale,\\r\\nSay what thou canst, I'll go along with thee.\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nWhy, whither shall we go?\\r\\nCELIA\\r\\nTo seek my uncle in the forest of Arden.\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nAlas, what danger will it be to us,\\r\\nMaids as we are, to travel forth so far!\\r\\nBeauty provoketh thieves sooner than gold.\\r\\nCELIA\\r\\nI'll put myself in poor and mean attire\\r\\nAnd with a kind of umber smirch my face;\\r\\nThe like do you: so shall we pass along\\r\\nAnd never stir assailants.\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nWere it not better,\\r\\nBecause that I am more than common tall,\\r\\nThat I did suit me all points like a man?\\r\\nA gallant curtle-axe upon my thigh,\\r\\nA boar-spear in my hand; and--in my heart\\r\\nLie there what hidden woman's fear there will--\\r\\nWe'll have a swashing and a martial outside,\\r\\nAs many other mannish cowards have\\r\\nThat do outface it with their semblances.\\r\\nCELIA\\r\\nWhat shall I call thee when thou art a man?\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nI'll have no worse a name than Jove's own page;\\r\\nAnd therefore look you call me Ganymede.\\r\\nBut what will you be call'd?\\r\\nCELIA\\r\\nSomething that hath a reference to my state\\r\\nNo longer Celia, but Aliena.\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nBut, cousin, what if we assay'd to steal\\r\\nThe clownish fool out of your father's court?\\r\\nWould he not be a comfort to our travel?\\r\\nCELIA\\r\\nHe'll go along o'er the wide world with me;\\r\\nLeave me alone to woo him. Let's away,\\r\\nAnd get our jewels and our wealth together,\\r\\nDevise the fittest time and safest way\\r\\nTo hide us from pursuit that will be made\\r\\nAfter my flight.

I met a fool i' the forest,\\r\\nA motley fool; a miserable world!\\r\\nAs I do live by food, I met a fool\\r\\nWho laid him down and bask'd him in the sun,\\r\\nAnd rail'd on Lady Fortune in good terms,\\r\\nIn good set terms and yet a motley fool.\\r\\n'Good morrow, fool,' quoth I. 'No, sir,' quoth he,\\r\\n'Call me not fool till heaven hath sent me fortune:'\\r\\nAnd then he drew a dial from his poke,\\r\\nAnd, looking on it with lack-lustre eye,\\r\\nSays very wisely, 'It is ten o'clock:\\r\\nThus we may see,' quoth he, 'how the world wags:\\r\\n'Tis but an hour ago since it was nine,\\r\\nAnd after one hour more 'twill be eleven;\\r\\nAnd so, from hour to hour, we ripe and ripe,\\r\\nAnd then, from hour to hour, we rot and rot;\\r\\nAnd thereby hangs a tale.' When I did hear\\r\\nThe motley fool thus moral on the time,\\r\\nMy lungs began to crow like chanticleer,\\r\\nThat fools should be so deep-contemplative,\\r\\nAnd I did laugh sans intermission\\r\\nAn hour by his dial.

At first the infant,\\r\\nMewling and puking in the nurse's arms.\\r\\nAnd then the whining school-boy, with his satchel\\r\\nAnd shining morning face, creeping like snail\\r\\nUnwillingly to school. And then the lover,\\r\\nSighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad\\r\\nMade to his mistress' eyebrow. Then a soldier,\\r\\nFull of strange oaths and bearded like the pard,\\r\\nJealous in honour, sudden and quick in quarrel,\\r\\nSeeking the bubble reputation\\r\\nEven in the cannon's mouth. And then the justice,\\r\\nIn fair round belly with good capon lined,\\r\\nWith eyes severe and beard of formal cut,\\r\\nFull of wise saws and modern instances;\\r\\nAnd so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts\\r\\nInto the lean and slipper'd pantaloon,\\r\\nWith spectacles on nose and pouch on side,\\r\\nHis youthful hose, well saved, a world too wide\\r\\nFor his shrunk shank; and his big manly voice,\\r\\nTurning again toward childish treble, pipes\\r\\nAnd whistles in his sound. Last scene of all,\\r\\nThat ends this strange eventful history,\\r\\nIs second childishness and mere oblivion,\\r\\nSans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything.\\r\\nRe-enter ORLANDO, with ADAM\\r\\n\\r\\nDUKE SENIOR\\r\\nWelcome.

The forest.\\r\\nEnter ORLANDO, with a paper\\r\\nORLANDO\\r\\nHang there, my verse, in witness of my love:\\r\\nAnd thou, thrice-crowned queen of night, survey\\r\\nWith thy chaste eye, from thy pale sphere above,\\r\\nThy huntress' name that my full life doth sway.\\r\\nO Rosalind! these trees shall be my books\\r\\nAnd in their barks my thoughts I'll character;\\r\\nThat every eye which in this forest looks\\r\\nShall see thy virtue witness'd every where.\\r\\nRun, run, Orlando; carve on every tree\\r\\nThe fair, the chaste and unexpressive she.\\r\\nExit\\r\\n\\r\\nEnter CORIN and TOUCHSTONE\\r\\n\\r\\nCORIN\\r\\nAnd how like you this shepherd's life, Master Touchstone?\\r\\nTOUCHSTONE\\r\\nTruly, shepherd, in respect of itself, it is a good\\r\\nlife, but in respect that it is a shepherd's life,\\r\\nit is naught. In respect that it is solitary, I\\r\\nlike it very well; but in respect that it is\\r\\nprivate, it is a very vile life. Now, in respect it\\r\\nis in the fields, it pleaseth me well; but in\\r\\nrespect it is not in the court, it is tedious. As\\r\\nis it a spare life, look you, it fits my humour well;\\r\\nbut as there is no more plenty in it, it goes much\\r\\nagainst my stomach. Hast any philosophy in thee, shepherd?\\r\\nCORIN\\r\\nNo more but that I know the more one sickens the\\r\\nworse at ease he is; and that he that wants money,\\r\\nmeans and content is without three good friends;\\r\\nthat the property of rain is to wet and fire to\\r\\nburn; that good pasture makes fat sheep, and that a\\r\\ngreat cause of the night is lack of the sun; that\\r\\nhe that hath learned no wit by nature nor art may\\r\\ncomplain of good breeding or comes of a very dull kindred.\\r\\nTOUCHSTONE\\r\\nSuch a one is a natural philosopher. Wast ever in\\r\\ncourt, shepherd?\\r\\nCORIN\\r\\nNo, truly.\\r\\nTOUCHSTONE\\r\\nThen thou art damned.\\r\\nCORIN\\r\\nNay, I hope.\\r\\nTOUCHSTONE\\r\\nTruly, thou art damned like an ill-roasted egg, all\\r\\non one side.\\r\\nCORIN\\r\\nFor not being at court? Your reason.\\r\\nTOUCHSTONE\\r\\nWhy, if thou never wast at court, thou never sawest\\r\\ngood manners; if thou never sawest good manners,\\r\\nthen thy manners must be wicked; and wickedness is\\r\\nsin, and sin is damnation. Thou art in a parlous\\r\\nstate, shepherd.\\r\\nCORIN\\r\\nNot a whit, Touchstone: those that are good manners\\r\\nat the court are as ridiculous in the country as the\\r\\nbehavior of the country is most mockable at the\\r\\ncourt. You told me you salute not at the court, but\\r\\nyou kiss your hands: that courtesy would be\\r\\nuncleanly, if courtiers were shepherds.\\r\\nTOUCHSTONE\\r\\nInstance, briefly; come, instance.\\r\\nCORIN\\r\\nWhy, we are still handling our ewes, and their\\r\\nfells, you know, are greasy.\\r\\nTOUCHSTONE\\r\\nWhy, do not your courtier's hands sweat? and is not\\r\\nthe grease of a mutton as wholesome as the sweat of\\r\\na man? Shallow, shallow. A better instance, I say; come.\\r\\nCORIN\\r\\nBesides, our hands are hard.\\r\\nTOUCHSTONE\\r\\nYour lips will feel them the sooner. Shallow again.\\r\\nA more sounder instance, come.\\r\\nCORIN\\r\\nAnd they are often tarred over with the surgery of\\r\\nour sheep: and would you have us kiss tar? The\\r\\ncourtier's hands are perfumed with civet.\\r\\nTOUCHSTONE\\r\\nMost shallow man! thou worms-meat, in respect of a\\r\\ngood piece of flesh indeed! Learn of the wise, and\\r\\nperpend: civet is of a baser birth than tar, the\\r\\nvery uncleanly flux of a cat. Mend the instance, shepherd.\\r\\nCORIN\\r\\nYou have too courtly a wit for me: I'll rest.\\r\\nTOUCHSTONE\\r\\nWilt thou rest damned? God help thee, shallow man!\\r\\nGod make incision in thee! thou art raw.\\r\\nCORIN\\r\\nSir, I am a true labourer: I earn that I eat, get\\r\\nthat I wear, owe no man hate, envy no man's\\r\\nhappiness, glad of other men's good, content with my\\r\\nharm, and the greatest of my pride is to see my ewes\\r\\ngraze and my lambs suck.\\r\\nTOUCHSTONE\\r\\nThat is another simple sin in you, to bring the ewes\\r\\nand the rams together and to offer to get your\\r\\nliving by the copulation of cattle; to be bawd to a\\r\\nbell-wether, and to betray a she-lamb of a\\r\\ntwelvemonth to a crooked-pated, old, cuckoldly ram,\\r\\nout of all reasonable match. If thou beest not\\r\\ndamned for this, the devil himself will have no\\r\\nshepherds; I cannot see else how thou shouldst\\r\\n'scape.\\r\\nCORIN\\r\\nHere comes young Master Ganymede, my new mistress's brother.\\r\\nEnter ROSALIND, with a paper, reading\\r\\n\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nFrom the east to western Ind,\\r\\nNo jewel is like Rosalind.\\r\\nHer worth, being mounted on the wind,\\r\\nThrough all the world bears Rosalind.\\r\\nAll the pictures fairest lined\\r\\nAre but black to Rosalind.\\r\\nLet no fair be kept in mind\\r\\nBut the fair of Rosalind.\\r\\nTOUCHSTONE\\r\\nI'll rhyme you so eight years together, dinners and\\r\\nsuppers and sleeping-hours excepted: it is the\\r\\nright butter-women's rank to market.\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nOut, fool!\\r\\nTOUCHSTONE\\r\\nFor a taste:\\r\\nIf a hart do lack a hind,\\r\\nLet him seek out Rosalind.\\r\\nIf the cat will after kind,\\r\\nSo be sure will Rosalind.\\r\\nWinter garments must be lined,\\r\\nSo must slender Rosalind.\\r\\nThey that reap must sheaf and bind;\\r\\nThen to cart with Rosalind.\\r\\nSweetest nut hath sourest rind,\\r\\nSuch a nut is Rosalind.\\r\\nHe that sweetest rose will find\\r\\nMust find love's prick and Rosalind.\\r\\nThis is the very false gallop of verses: why do you\\r\\ninfect yourself with them?\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nPeace, you dull fool! I found them on a tree.\\r\\nTOUCHSTONE\\r\\nTruly, the tree yields bad fruit.\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nI'll graff it with you, and then I shall graff it\\r\\nwith a medlar: then it will be the earliest fruit\\r\\ni' the country; for you'll be rotten ere you be half\\r\\nripe, and that's the right virtue of the medlar.\\r\\nTOUCHSTONE\\r\\nYou have said; but whether wisely or no, let the\\r\\nforest judge.\\r\\nEnter CELIA, with a writing\\r\\n\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nPeace! Here comes my sister, reading: stand aside.\\r\\nCELIA\\r\\n[Reads]\\r\\nWhy should this a desert be?\\r\\nFor it is unpeopled? No:\\r\\nTongues I'll hang on every tree,\\r\\nThat shall civil sayings show:\\r\\nSome, how brief the life of man\\r\\nRuns his erring pilgrimage,\\r\\nThat the stretching of a span\\r\\nBuckles in his sum of age;\\r\\nSome, of violated vows\\r\\n'Twixt the souls of friend and friend:\\r\\nBut upon the fairest boughs,\\r\\nOr at every sentence end,\\r\\nWill I Rosalinda write,\\r\\nTeaching all that read to know\\r\\nThe quintessence of every sprite\\r\\nHeaven would in little show.\\r\\nTherefore Heaven Nature charged\\r\\nThat one body should be fill'd\\r\\nWith all graces wide-enlarged:\\r\\nNature presently distill'd\\r\\nHelen's cheek, but not her heart,\\r\\nCleopatra's majesty,\\r\\nAtalanta's better part,\\r\\nSad Lucretia's modesty.\\r\\nThus Rosalind of many parts\\r\\nBy heavenly synod was devised,\\r\\nOf many faces, eyes and hearts,\\r\\nTo have the touches dearest prized.\\r\\nHeaven would that she these gifts should have,\\r\\nAnd I to live and die her slave.\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nO most gentle pulpiter! what tedious homily of love\\r\\nhave you wearied your parishioners withal, and never\\r\\ncried 'Have patience, good people!'\\r\\nCELIA\\r\\nHow now! back, friends! Shepherd, go off a little.\\r\\nGo with him, sirrah.\\r\\nTOUCHSTONE\\r\\nCome, shepherd, let us make an honourable retreat;\\r\\nthough not with bag and baggage, yet with scrip and scrippage.\\r\\nExeunt CORIN and TOUCHSTONE\\r\\n\\r\\nCELIA\\r\\nDidst thou hear these verses?\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nO, yes, I heard them all, and more too; for some of\\r\\nthem had in them more feet than the verses would bear.\\r\\nCELIA\\r\\nThat's no matter: the feet might bear the verses.\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nAy, but the feet were lame and could not bear\\r\\nthemselves without the verse and therefore stood\\r\\nlamely in the verse.\\r\\nCELIA\\r\\nBut didst thou hear without wondering how thy name\\r\\nshould be hanged and carved upon these trees?\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nI was seven of the nine days out of the wonder\\r\\nbefore you came; for look here what I found on a\\r\\npalm-tree. I was never so be-rhymed since\\r\\nPythagoras' time, that I was an Irish rat, which I\\r\\ncan hardly remember.\\r\\nCELIA\\r\\nTrow you who hath done this?\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nIs it a man?\\r\\nCELIA\\r\\nAnd a chain, that you once wore, about his neck.\\r\\nChange you colour?\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nI prithee, who?\\r\\nCELIA\\r\\nO Lord, Lord! it is a hard matter for friends to\\r\\nmeet; but mountains may be removed with earthquakes\\r\\nand so encounter.\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nNay, but who is it?\\r\\nCELIA\\r\\nIs it possible?\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nNay, I prithee now with most petitionary vehemence,\\r\\ntell me who it is.\\r\\nCELIA\\r\\nO wonderful, wonderful, and most wonderful\\r\\nwonderful! and yet again wonderful, and after that,\\r\\nout of all hooping!\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nGood my complexion! dost thou think, though I am\\r\\ncaparisoned like a man, I have a doublet and hose in\\r\\nmy disposition? One inch of delay more is a\\r\\nSouth-sea of discovery; I prithee, tell me who is it\\r\\nquickly, and speak apace. I would thou couldst\\r\\nstammer, that thou mightst pour this concealed man\\r\\nout of thy mouth, as wine comes out of a narrow-\\r\\nmouthed bottle, either too much at once, or none at\\r\\nall. I prithee, take the cork out of thy mouth that\\r\\nmay drink thy tidings.\\r\\nCELIA\\r\\nSo you may put a man in your belly.\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nIs he of God's making? What manner of man? Is his\\r\\nhead worth a hat, or his chin worth a beard?\\r\\nCELIA\\r\\nNay, he hath but a little beard.\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nWhy, God will send more, if the man will be\\r\\nthankful: let me stay the growth of his beard, if\\r\\nthou delay me not the knowledge of his chin.\\r\\nCELIA\\r\\nIt is young Orlando, that tripped up the wrestler's\\r\\nheels and your heart both in an instant.\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nNay, but the devil take mocking: speak, sad brow and\\r\\ntrue maid.\\r\\nCELIA\\r\\nI' faith, coz, 'tis he.\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nOrlando?\\r\\nCELIA\\r\\nOrlando.\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nAlas the day! what shall I do with my doublet and\\r\\nhose? What did he when thou sawest him? What said\\r\\nhe? How looked he? Wherein went he? What makes\\r\\nhim here? Did he ask for me? Where remains he?\\r\\nHow parted he with thee? and when shalt thou see\\r\\nhim again? Answer me in one word.\\r\\nCELIA\\r\\nYou must borrow me Gargantua's mouth first: 'tis a\\r\\nword too great for any mouth of this age's size. To\\r\\nsay ay and no to these particulars is more than to\\r\\nanswer in a catechism.\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nBut doth he know that I am in this forest and in\\r\\nman's apparel? Looks he as freshly as he did the\\r\\nday he wrestled?\\r\\nCELIA\\r\\nIt is as easy to count atomies as to resolve the\\r\\npropositions of a lover; but take a taste of my\\r\\nfinding him, and relish it with good observance.\\r\\nI found him under a tree, like a dropped acorn.\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nIt may well be called Jove's tree, when it drops\\r\\nforth such fruit.\\r\\nCELIA\\r\\nGive me audience, good madam.\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nProceed.\\r\\nCELIA\\r\\nThere lay he, stretched along, like a wounded knight.\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nThough it be pity to see such a sight, it well\\r\\nbecomes the ground.\\r\\nCELIA\\r\\nCry 'holla' to thy tongue, I prithee; it curvets\\r\\nunseasonably.

Will you sit down with me? and\\r\\nwe two will rail against our mistress the world and\\r\\nall our misery.\\r\\nORLANDO\\r\\nI will chide no breather in the world but myself,\\r\\nagainst whom I know most faults.\\r\\nJAQUES\\r\\nThe worst fault you have is to be in love.\\r\\nORLANDO\\r\\n'Tis a fault I will not change for your best virtue.\\r\\nI am weary of you.\\r\\nJAQUES\\r\\nBy my troth, I was seeking for a fool when I found\\r\\nyou.\\r\\nORLANDO\\r\\nHe is drowned in the brook: look but in, and you\\r\\nshall see him.\\r\\nJAQUES\\r\\nThere I shall see mine own figure.\\r\\nORLANDO\\r\\nWhich I take to be either a fool or a cipher.\\r\\nJAQUES\\r\\nI'll tarry no longer with you: farewell, good\\r\\nSignior Love.\\r\\nORLANDO\\r\\nI am glad of your departure: adieu, good Monsieur\\r\\nMelancholy.\\r\\nExit JAQUES\\r\\n\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\n[Aside to CELIA] I will speak to him, like a saucy\\r\\nlackey and under that habit play the knave with him.\\r\\nDo you hear, forester?\\r\\nORLANDO\\r\\nVery well: what would you?\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nI pray you, what is't o'clock?\\r\\nORLANDO\\r\\nYou should ask me what time o' day: there's no clock\\r\\nin the forest.\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nThen there is no true lover in the forest; else\\r\\nsighing every minute and groaning every hour would\\r\\ndetect the lazy foot of Time as well as a clock.\\r\\nORLANDO\\r\\nAnd why not the swift foot of Time? had not that\\r\\nbeen as proper?\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nBy no means, sir: Time travels in divers paces with\\r\\ndivers persons. I'll tell you who Time ambles\\r\\nwithal, who Time trots withal, who Time gallops\\r\\nwithal and who he stands still withal.\\r\\nORLANDO\\r\\nI prithee, who doth he trot withal?\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nMarry, he trots hard with a young maid between the\\r\\ncontract of her marriage and the day it is\\r\\nsolemnized: if the interim be but a se'nnight,\\r\\nTime's pace is so hard that it seems the length of\\r\\nseven year.\\r\\nORLANDO\\r\\nWho ambles Time withal?\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nWith a priest that lacks Latin and a rich man that\\r\\nhath not the gout, for the one sleeps easily because\\r\\nhe cannot study, and the other lives merrily because\\r\\nhe feels no pain, the one lacking the burden of lean\\r\\nand wasteful learning, the other knowing no burden\\r\\nof heavy tedious penury; these Time ambles withal.\\r\\nORLANDO\\r\\nWho doth he gallop withal?\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nWith a thief to the gallows, for though he go as\\r\\nsoftly as foot can fall, he thinks himself too soon there.\\r\\nORLANDO\\r\\nWho stays it still withal?\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nWith lawyers in the vacation, for they sleep between\\r\\nterm and term and then they perceive not how Time moves.\\r\\nORLANDO\\r\\nWhere dwell you, pretty youth?\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nWith this shepherdess, my sister; here in the\\r\\nskirts of the forest, like fringe upon a petticoat.\\r\\nORLANDO\\r\\nAre you native of this place?\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nAs the cony that you see dwell where she is kindled.\\r\\nORLANDO\\r\\nYour accent is something finer than you could\\r\\npurchase in so removed a dwelling.\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nI have been told so of many: but indeed an old\\r\\nreligious uncle of mine taught me to speak, who was\\r\\nin his youth an inland man; one that knew courtship\\r\\ntoo well, for there he fell in love. I have heard\\r\\nhim read many lectures against it, and I thank God\\r\\nI am not a woman, to be touched with so many\\r\\ngiddy offences as he hath generally taxed their\\r\\nwhole sex withal.\\r\\nORLANDO\\r\\nCan you remember any of the principal evils that he\\r\\nlaid to the charge of women?\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nThere were none principal; they were all like one\\r\\nanother as half-pence are, every one fault seeming\\r\\nmonstrous till his fellow fault came to match it.\\r\\nORLANDO\\r\\nI prithee, recount some of them.\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nNo, I will not cast away my physic but on those that\\r\\nare sick. There is a man haunts the forest, that\\r\\nabuses our young plants with carving 'Rosalind' on\\r\\ntheir barks; hangs odes upon hawthorns and elegies\\r\\non brambles, all, forsooth, deifying the name of\\r\\nRosalind: if I could meet that fancy-monger I would\\r\\ngive him some good counsel, for he seems to have the\\r\\nquotidian of love upon him.\\r\\nORLANDO\\r\\nI am he that is so love-shaked: I pray you tell me\\r\\nyour remedy.\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nThere is none of my uncle's marks upon you: he\\r\\ntaught me how to know a man in love; in which cage\\r\\nof rushes I am sure you are not prisoner.\\r\\nORLANDO\\r\\nWhat were his marks?\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nA lean cheek, which you have not, a blue eye and\\r\\nsunken, which you have not, an unquestionable\\r\\nspirit, which you have not, a beard neglected,\\r\\nwhich you have not; but I pardon you for that, for\\r\\nsimply your having in beard is a younger brother's\\r\\nrevenue: then your hose should be ungartered, your\\r\\nbonnet unbanded, your sleeve unbuttoned, your shoe\\r\\nuntied and every thing about you demonstrating a\\r\\ncareless desolation; but you are no such man; you\\r\\nare rather point-device in your accoutrements as\\r\\nloving yourself than seeming the lover of any other.\\r\\nORLANDO\\r\\nFair youth, I would I could make thee believe I love.\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nMe believe it! you may as soon make her that you\\r\\nlove believe it; which, I warrant, she is apter to\\r\\ndo than to confess she does: that is one of the\\r\\npoints in the which women still give the lie to\\r\\ntheir consciences. But, in good sooth, are you he\\r\\nthat hangs the verses on the trees, wherein Rosalind\\r\\nis so admired?\\r\\nORLANDO\\r\\nI swear to thee, youth, by the white hand of\\r\\nRosalind, I am that he, that unfortunate he.\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nBut are you so much in love as your rhymes speak?\\r\\nORLANDO\\r\\nNeither rhyme nor reason can express how much.\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nLove is merely a madness, and, I tell you, deserves\\r\\nas well a dark house and a whip as madmen do: and\\r\\nthe reason why they are not so punished and cured\\r\\nis, that the lunacy is so ordinary that the whippers\\r\\nare in love too. Yet I profess curing it by counsel.\\r\\nORLANDO\\r\\nDid you ever cure any so?\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nYes, one, and in this manner. He was to imagine me\\r\\nhis love, his mistress; and I set him every day to\\r\\nwoo me: at which time would I, being but a moonish\\r\\nyouth, grieve, be effeminate, changeable, longing\\r\\nand liking, proud, fantastical, apish, shallow,\\r\\ninconstant, full of tears, full of smiles, for every\\r\\npassion something and for no passion truly any\\r\\nthing, as boys and women are for the most part\\r\\ncattle of this colour; would now like him, now loathe\\r\\nhim; then entertain him, then forswear him; now weep\\r\\nfor him, then spit at him; that I drave my suitor\\r\\nfrom his mad humour of love to a living humour of\\r\\nmadness; which was, to forswear the full stream of\\r\\nthe world, and to live in a nook merely monastic.\\r\\nAnd thus I cured him; and this way will I take upon\\r\\nme to wash your liver as clean as a sound sheep's\\r\\nheart, that there shall not be one spot of love in't.\\r\\nORLANDO\\r\\nI would not be cured, youth.\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nI would cure you, if you would but call me Rosalind\\r\\nand come every day to my cote and woo me.\\r\\nORLANDO\\r\\nNow, by the faith of my love, I will: tell me\\r\\nwhere it is.\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nGo with me to it and I'll show it you and by the way\\r\\nyou shall tell me where in the forest you live.\\r\\nWill you go?\\r\\nORLANDO\\r\\nWith all my heart, good youth.\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nNay you must call me Rosalind. Come, sister, will you go?\\r\\nExeunt\\r\\n\\r\\nSCENE III.

But be it as it may\\r\\nbe, I will marry thee, and to that end I have been\\r\\nwith Sir Oliver Martext, the vicar of the next\\r\\nvillage, who hath promised to meet me in this place\\r\\nof the forest and to couple us.\\r\\nJAQUES\\r\\n[Aside] I would fain see this meeting.\\r\\nAUDREY\\r\\nWell, the gods give us joy!\\r\\nTOUCHSTONE\\r\\nAmen. A man may, if he were of a fearful heart,\\r\\nstagger in this attempt; for here we have no temple\\r\\nbut the wood, no assembly but horn-beasts. But what\\r\\nthough? C ourage! As horns are odious, they are\\r\\nnecessary. It is said, 'many a man knows no end of\\r\\nhis goods:' right; many a man has good horns, and\\r\\nknows no end of them. Well, that is the dowry of\\r\\nhis wife; 'tis none of his own getting. Horns?\\r\\nEven so. Poor men alone? No, no; the noblest deer\\r\\nhath them as huge as the rascal. Is the single man\\r\\ntherefore blessed? No: as a walled town is more\\r\\nworthier than a village, so is the forehead of a\\r\\nmarried man more honourable than the bare brow of a\\r\\nbachelor; and by how much defence is better than no\\r\\nskill, by so much is a horn more precious than to\\r\\nwant. Here comes Sir Oliver.\\r\\nEnter SIR OLIVER MARTEXT\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Oliver Martext, you are well met: will you\\r\\ndispatch us here under this tree, or shall we go\\r\\nwith you to your chapel?\\r\\nSIR OLIVER MARTEXT\\r\\nIs there none here to give the woman?\\r\\nTOUCHSTONE\\r\\nI will not take her on gift of any man.\\r\\nSIR OLIVER MARTEXT\\r\\nTruly, she must be given, or the marriage is not lawful.\\r\\nJAQUES\\r\\n[Advancing]\\r\\nProceed, proceed I'll give her.\\r\\nTOUCHSTONE\\r\\nGood even, good Master What-ye-call't: how do you,\\r\\nsir? You are very well met: God 'ild you for your\\r\\nlast company: I am very glad to see you: even a\\r\\ntoy in hand here, sir: nay, pray be covered.\\r\\nJAQUES\\r\\nWill you be married, motley?\\r\\nTOUCHSTONE\\r\\nAs the ox hath his bow, sir, the horse his curb and\\r\\nthe falcon her bells, so man hath his desires; and\\r\\nas pigeons bill, so wedlock would be nibbling.\\r\\nJAQUES\\r\\nAnd will you, being a man of your breeding, be\\r\\nmarried under a bush like a beggar? Get you to\\r\\nchurch, and have a good priest that can tell you\\r\\nwhat marriage is: this fellow will but join you\\r\\ntogether as they join wainscot; then one of you will\\r\\nprove a shrunk panel and, like green timber, warp, warp.\\r\\nTOUCHSTONE\\r\\n[Aside] I am not in the mind but I were better to be\\r\\nmarried of him than of another: for he is not like\\r\\nto marry me well; and not being well married, it\\r\\nwill be a good excuse for me hereafter to leave my wife.\\r\\nJAQUES\\r\\nGo thou with me, and let me counsel thee.\\r\\nTOUCHSTONE\\r\\n'Come, sweet Audrey:\\r\\nWe must be married, or we must live in bawdry.\\r\\nFarewell, good Master Oliver: not,--\\r\\nO sweet Oliver,\\r\\nO brave Oliver,\\r\\nLeave me not behind thee: but,--\\r\\nWind away,\\r\\nBegone, I say,\\r\\nI will not to wedding with thee.\\r\\nExeunt JAQUES, TOUCHSTONE and AUDREY\\r\\n\\r\\nSIR OLIVER MARTEXT\\r\\n'Tis no matter: ne'er a fantastical knave of them\\r\\nall shall flout me out of my calling.\\r\\nExit\\r\\n\\r\\nSCENE IV. The forest.\\r\\nEnter ROSALIND and CELIA\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nNever talk to me; I will weep.\\r\\nCELIA\\r\\nDo, I prithee; but yet have the grace to consider\\r\\nthat tears do not become a man.\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nBut have I not cause to weep?\\r\\nCELIA\\r\\nAs good cause as one would desire; therefore weep.\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nHis very hair is of the dissembling colour.\\r\\nCELIA\\r\\nSomething browner than Judas's marry, his kisses are\\r\\nJudas's own children.\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nI' faith, his hair is of a good colour.\\r\\nCELIA\\r\\nAn excellent colour: your chestnut was ever the only colour.\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nAnd his kissing is as full of sanctity as the touch\\r\\nof holy bread.\\r\\nCELIA\\r\\nHe hath bought a pair of cast lips of Diana: a nun\\r\\nof winter's sisterhood kisses not more religiously;\\r\\nthe very ice of chastity is in them.\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nBut why did he swear he would come this morning, and\\r\\ncomes not?\\r\\nCELIA\\r\\nNay, certainly, there is no truth in him.\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nDo you think so?\\r\\nCELIA\\r\\nYes; I think he is not a pick-purse nor a\\r\\nhorse-stealer, but for his verity in love, I do\\r\\nthink him as concave as a covered goblet or a\\r\\nworm-eaten nut.\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nNot true in love?\\r\\nCELIA\\r\\nYes, when he is in; but I think he is not in.\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nYou have heard him swear downright he was.\\r\\nCELIA\\r\\n'Was' is not 'is:' besides, the oath of a lover is\\r\\nno stronger than the word of a tapster; they are\\r\\nboth the confirmer of false reckonings. He attends\\r\\nhere in the forest on the duke your father.\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nI met the duke yesterday and had much question with\\r\\nhim: he asked me of what parentage I was; I told\\r\\nhim, of as good as he; so he laughed and let me go.\\r\\nBut what talk we of fathers, when there is such a\\r\\nman as Orlando?\\r\\nCELIA\\r\\nO, that's a brave man! he writes brave verses,\\r\\nspeaks brave words, swears brave oaths and breaks\\r\\nthem bravely, quite traverse, athwart the heart of\\r\\nhis lover; as a puisny tilter, that spurs his horse\\r\\nbut on one side, breaks his staff like a noble\\r\\ngoose: but all's brave that youth mounts and folly\\r\\nguides. Who comes here?\\r\\nEnter CORIN\\r\\n\\r\\nCORIN\\r\\nMistress and master, you have oft inquired\\r\\nAfter the shepherd that complain'd of love,\\r\\nWho you saw sitting by me on the turf,\\r\\nPraising the proud disdainful shepherdess\\r\\nThat was his mistress.\\r\\nCELIA\\r\\nWell, and what of him?\\r\\nCORIN\\r\\nIf you will see a pageant truly play'd,\\r\\nBetween the pale complexion of true love\\r\\nAnd the red glow of scorn and proud disdain,\\r\\nGo hence a little and I shall conduct you,\\r\\nIf you will mark it.\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nO, come, let us remove:\\r\\nThe sight of lovers feedeth those in love.\\r\\nBring us to this sight, and you shall say\\r\\nI'll prove a busy actor in their play.\\r\\nExeunt\\r\\n\\r\\nSCENE V. Another part of the forest.\\r\\nEnter SILVIUS and PHEBE\\r\\nSILVIUS\\r\\nSweet Phebe, do not scorn me; do not, Phebe;\\r\\nSay that you love me not, but say not so\\r\\nIn bitterness. The common executioner,\\r\\nWhose heart the accustom'd sight of death makes hard,\\r\\nFalls not the axe upon the humbled neck\\r\\nBut first begs pardon: will you sterner be\\r\\nThan he that dies and lives by bloody drops?\\r\\nEnter ROSALIND, CELIA, and CORIN, behind\\r\\n\\r\\nPHEBE\\r\\nI would not be thy executioner:\\r\\nI fly thee, for I would not injure thee.\\r\\nThou tell'st me there is murder in mine eye:\\r\\n'Tis pretty, sure, and very probable,\\r\\nThat eyes, that are the frail'st and softest things,\\r\\nWho shut their coward gates on atomies,\\r\\nShould be call'd tyrants, butchers, murderers!\\r\\nNow I do frown on thee with all my heart;\\r\\nAnd if mine eyes can wound, now let them kill thee:\\r\\nNow counterfeit to swoon; why now fall down;\\r\\nOr if thou canst not, O, for shame, for shame,\\r\\nLie not, to say mine eyes are murderers!\\r\\nNow show the wound mine eye hath made in thee:\\r\\nScratch thee but with a pin, and there remains\\r\\nSome scar of it; lean but upon a rush,\\r\\nThe cicatrice and capable impressure\\r\\nThy palm some moment keeps; but now mine eyes,\\r\\nWhich I have darted at thee, hurt thee not,\\r\\nNor, I am sure, there is no force in eyes\\r\\nThat can do hurt.\\r\\nSILVIUS\\r\\nO dear Phebe,\\r\\nIf ever,--as that ever may be near,--\\r\\nYou meet in some fresh cheek the power of fancy,\\r\\nThen shall you know the wounds invisible\\r\\nThat love's keen arrows make.\\r\\nPHEBE\\r\\nBut till that time\\r\\nCome not thou near me: and when that time comes,\\r\\nAfflict me with thy mocks, pity me not;\\r\\nAs till that time I shall not pity thee.\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nAnd why, I pray you?

What though you have no beauty,--\\r\\nAs, by my faith, I see no more in you\\r\\nThan without candle may go dark to bed--\\r\\nMust you be therefore proud and pitiless?\\r\\nWhy, what means this? Why do you look on me?\\r\\nI see no more in you than in the ordinary\\r\\nOf nature's sale-work. 'Od's my little life,\\r\\nI think she means to tangle my eyes too!\\r\\nNo, faith, proud mistress, hope not after it:\\r\\n'Tis not your inky brows, your black silk hair,\\r\\nYour bugle eyeballs, nor your cheek of cream,\\r\\nThat can entame my spirits to your worship.\\r\\nYou foolish shepherd, wherefore do you follow her,\\r\\nLike foggy south puffing with wind and rain?\\r\\nYou are a thousand times a properer man\\r\\nThan she a woman: 'tis such fools as you\\r\\nThat makes the world full of ill-favour'd children:\\r\\n'Tis not her glass, but you, that flatters her;\\r\\nAnd out of you she sees herself more proper\\r\\nThan any of her lineaments can show her.\\r\\nBut, mistress, know yourself: down on your knees,\\r\\nAnd thank heaven, fasting, for a good man's love:\\r\\nFor I must tell you friendly in your ear,\\r\\nSell when you can: you are not for all markets:\\r\\nCry the man mercy; love him; take his offer:\\r\\nFoul is most foul, being foul to be a scoffer.\\r\\nSo take her to thee, shepherd: fare you well.\\r\\nPHEBE\\r\\nSweet youth, I pray you, chide a year together:\\r\\nI had rather hear you chide than this man woo.\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nHe's fallen in love with your foulness and she'll\\r\\nfall in love with my anger.

The forest.\\r\\nEnter ROSALIND, CELIA, and JAQUES\\r\\nJAQUES\\r\\nI prithee, pretty youth, let me be better acquainted\\r\\nwith thee.\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nThey say you are a melancholy fellow.\\r\\nJAQUES\\r\\nI am so; I do love it better than laughing.\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nThose that are in extremity of either are abominable\\r\\nfellows and betray themselves to every modern\\r\\ncensure worse than drunkards.\\r\\nJAQUES\\r\\nWhy, 'tis good to be sad and say nothing.\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nWhy then, 'tis good to be a post.\\r\\nJAQUES\\r\\nI have neither the scholar's melancholy, which is\\r\\nemulation, nor the musician's, which is fantastical,\\r\\nnor the courtier's, which is proud, nor the\\r\\nsoldier's, which is ambitious, nor the lawyer's,\\r\\nwhich is politic, nor the lady's, which is nice, nor\\r\\nthe lover's, which is all these: but it is a\\r\\nmelancholy of mine own, compounded of many simples,\\r\\nextracted from many objects, and indeed the sundry's\\r\\ncontemplation of my travels, in which my often\\r\\nrumination wraps me m a most humorous sadness.\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nA traveller! By my faith, you have great reason to\\r\\nbe sad: I fear you have sold your own lands to see\\r\\nother men's; then, to have seen much and to have\\r\\nnothing, is to have rich eyes and poor hands.\\r\\nJAQUES\\r\\nYes, I have gained my experience.\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nAnd your experience makes you sad: I had rather have\\r\\na fool to make me merry than experience to make me\\r\\nsad; and to travel for it too!\\r\\nEnter ORLANDO\\r\\n\\r\\nORLANDO\\r\\nGood day and happiness, dear Rosalind!\\r\\nJAQUES\\r\\nNay, then, God be wi' you, an you talk in blank verse.\\r\\nExit\\r\\n\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nFarewell, Monsieur Traveller: look you lisp and\\r\\nwear strange suits, disable all the benefits of your\\r\\nown country, be out of love with your nativity and\\r\\nalmost chide God for making you that countenance you\\r\\nare, or I will scarce think you have swam in a\\r\\ngondola. Why, how now, Orlando! where have you been\\r\\nall this while? You a lover! An you serve me such\\r\\nanother trick, never come in my sight more.\\r\\nORLANDO\\r\\nMy fair Rosalind, I come within an hour of my promise.\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nBreak an hour's promise in love! He that will\\r\\ndivide a minute into a thousand parts and break but\\r\\na part of the thousandth part of a minute in the\\r\\naffairs of love, it may be said of him that Cupid\\r\\nhath clapped him o' the shoulder, but I'll warrant\\r\\nhim heart-whole.\\r\\nORLANDO\\r\\nPardon me, dear Rosalind.\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nNay, an you be so tardy, come no more in my sight: I\\r\\nhad as lief be wooed of a snail.\\r\\nORLANDO\\r\\nOf a snail?\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nAy, of a snail; for though he comes slowly, he\\r\\ncarries his house on his head; a better jointure,\\r\\nI think, than you make a woman: besides he brings\\r\\nhis destiny with him.\\r\\nORLANDO\\r\\nWhat's that?\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nWhy, horns, which such as you are fain to be\\r\\nbeholding to your wives for: but he comes armed in\\r\\nhis fortune and prevents the slander of his wife.\\r\\nORLANDO\\r\\nVirtue is no horn-maker; and my Rosalind is virtuous.\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nAnd I am your Rosalind.\\r\\nCELIA\\r\\nIt pleases him to call you so; but he hath a\\r\\nRosalind of a better leer than you.\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nCome, woo me, woo me, for now I am in a holiday\\r\\nhumour and like enough to consent. What would you\\r\\nsay to me now, an I were your very very Rosalind?\\r\\nORLANDO\\r\\nI would kiss before I spoke.\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nNay, you were better speak first, and when you were\\r\\ngravelled for lack of matter, you might take\\r\\noccasion to kiss. Very good orators, when they are\\r\\nout, they will spit; and for lovers lacking--God\\r\\nwarn us!--matter, the cleanliest shift is to kiss.\\r\\nORLANDO\\r\\nHow if the kiss be denied?\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nThen she puts you to entreaty, and there begins new matter.\\r\\nORLANDO\\r\\nWho could be out, being before his beloved mistress?\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nMarry, that should you, if I were your mistress, or\\r\\nI should think my honesty ranker than my wit.\\r\\nORLANDO\\r\\nWhat, of my suit?\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nNot out of your apparel, and yet out of your suit.\\r\\nAm not I your Rosalind?\\r\\nORLANDO\\r\\nI take some joy to say you are, because I would be\\r\\ntalking of her.\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nWell in her person I say I will not have you.\\r\\nORLANDO\\r\\nThen in mine own person I die.\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nNo, faith, die by attorney. The poor world is\\r\\nalmost six thousand years old, and in all this time\\r\\nthere was not any man died in his own person,\\r\\nvidelicit, in a love-cause. Troilus had his brains\\r\\ndashed out with a Grecian club; yet he did what he\\r\\ncould to die before, and he is one of the patterns\\r\\nof love. Leander, he would have lived many a fair\\r\\nyear, though Hero had turned nun, if it had not been\\r\\nfor a hot midsummer night; for, good youth, he went\\r\\nbut forth to wash him in the Hellespont and being\\r\\ntaken with the cramp was drowned and the foolish\\r\\ncoroners of that age found it was 'Hero of Sestos.'\\r\\nBut these are all lies: men have died from time to\\r\\ntime and worms have eaten them, but not for love.\\r\\nORLANDO\\r\\nI would not have my right Rosalind of this mind,\\r\\nfor, I protest, her frown might kill me.\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nBy this hand, it will not kill a fly. But come, now\\r\\nI will be your Rosalind in a more coming-on\\r\\ndisposition, and ask me what you will. I will grant\\r\\nit.\\r\\nORLANDO\\r\\nThen love me, Rosalind.\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nYes, faith, will I, Fridays and Saturdays and all.\\r\\nORLANDO\\r\\nAnd wilt thou have me?\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nAy, and twenty such.\\r\\nORLANDO\\r\\nWhat sayest thou?\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nAre you not good?\\r\\nORLANDO\\r\\nI hope so.\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nWhy then, can one desire too much of a good thing?\\r\\nCome, sister, you shall be the priest and marry us.\\r\\nGive me your hand, Orlando. What do you say, sister?\\r\\nORLANDO\\r\\nPray thee, marry us.\\r\\nCELIA\\r\\nI cannot say the words.\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nYou must begin, 'Will you, Orlando--'\\r\\nCELIA\\r\\nGo to. Will you, Orlando, have to wife this Rosalind?\\r\\nORLANDO\\r\\nI will.\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nAy, but when?\\r\\nORLANDO\\r\\nWhy now; as fast as she can marry us.\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nThen you must say 'I take thee, Rosalind, for wife.'\\r\\nORLANDO\\r\\nI take thee, Rosalind, for wife.\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nI might ask you for your commission; but I do take\\r\\nthee, Orlando, for my husband: there's a girl goes\\r\\nbefore the priest; and certainly a woman's thought\\r\\nruns before her actions.\\r\\nORLANDO\\r\\nSo do all thoughts; they are winged.\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nNow tell me how long you would have her after you\\r\\nhave possessed her.\\r\\nORLANDO\\r\\nFor ever and a day.\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nSay 'a day,' without the 'ever.' No, no, Orlando;\\r\\nmen are April when they woo, December when they wed:\\r\\nmaids are May when they are maids, but the sky\\r\\nchanges when they are wives. I will be more jealous\\r\\nof thee than a Barbary cock-pigeon over his hen,\\r\\nmore clamorous than a parrot against rain, more\\r\\nnew-fangled than an ape, more giddy in my desires\\r\\nthan a monkey: I will weep for nothing, like Diana\\r\\nin the fountain, and I will do that when you are\\r\\ndisposed to be merry; I will laugh like a hyen, and\\r\\nthat when thou art inclined to sleep.\\r\\nORLANDO\\r\\nBut will my Rosalind do so?\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nBy my life, she will do as I do.\\r\\nORLANDO\\r\\nO, but she is wise.\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nOr else she could not have the wit to do this: the\\r\\nwiser, the waywarder: make the doors upon a woman's\\r\\nwit and it will out at the casement; shut that and\\r\\n'twill out at the key-hole; stop that, 'twill fly\\r\\nwith the smoke out at the chimney.\\r\\nORLANDO\\r\\nA man that had a wife with such a wit, he might say\\r\\n'Wit, whither wilt?'\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nNay, you might keep that cheque for it till you met\\r\\nyour wife's wit going to your neighbour's bed.\\r\\nORLANDO\\r\\nAnd what wit could wit have to excuse that?\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nMarry, to say she came to seek you there. You shall\\r\\nnever take her without her answer, unless you take\\r\\nher without her tongue. O, that woman that cannot\\r\\nmake her fault her husband's occasion, let her\\r\\nnever nurse her child herself, for she will breed\\r\\nit like a fool!\\r\\nORLANDO\\r\\nFor these two hours, Rosalind, I will leave thee.\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nAlas! dear love, I cannot lack thee two hours.\\r\\nORLANDO\\r\\nI must attend the duke at dinner: by two o'clock I\\r\\nwill be with thee again.\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nAy, go your ways, go your ways; I knew what you\\r\\nwould prove: my friends told me as much, and I\\r\\nthought no less: that flattering tongue of yours\\r\\nwon me: 'tis but one cast away, and so, come,\\r\\ndeath!

Here comes a pair of\\r\\nvery strange beasts, which in all tongues are called fools.\\r\\nTOUCHSTONE\\r\\nSalutation and greeting to you all!\\r\\nJAQUES\\r\\nGood my lord, bid him welcome: this is the\\r\\nmotley-minded gentleman that I have so often met in\\r\\nthe forest: he hath been a courtier, he swears.\\r\\nTOUCHSTONE\\r\\nIf any man doubt that, let him put me to my\\r\\npurgation. I have trod a measure; I have flattered\\r\\na lady; I have been politic with my friend, smooth\\r\\nwith mine enemy; I have undone three tailors; I have\\r\\nhad four quarrels, and like to have fought one.\\r\\nJAQUES\\r\\nAnd how was that ta'en up?\\r\\nTOUCHSTONE\\r\\nFaith, we met, and found the quarrel was upon the\\r\\nseventh cause.\\r\\nJAQUES\\r\\nHow seventh cause? Good my lord, like this fellow.\\r\\nDUKE SENIOR\\r\\nI like him very well.\\r\\nTOUCHSTONE\\r\\nGod 'ild you, sir; I desire you of the like. I\\r\\npress in here, sir, amongst the rest of the country\\r\\ncopulatives, to swear and to forswear: according as\\r\\nmarriage binds and blood breaks: a poor virgin,\\r\\nsir, an ill-favoured thing, sir, but mine own; a poor\\r\\nhumour of mine, sir, to take that that no man else\\r\\nwill: rich honesty dwells like a miser, sir, in a\\r\\npoor house; as your pearl in your foul oyster.\\r\\nDUKE SENIOR\\r\\nBy my faith, he is very swift and sententious.\\r\\nTOUCHSTONE\\r\\nAccording to the fool's bolt, sir, and such dulcet diseases.\\r\\nJAQUES\\r\\nBut, for the seventh cause; how did you find the\\r\\nquarrel on the seventh cause?\\r\\nTOUCHSTONE\\r\\nUpon a lie seven times removed:--bear your body more\\r\\nseeming, Audrey:--as thus, sir. I did dislike the\\r\\ncut of a certain courtier's beard: he sent me word,\\r\\nif I said his beard was not cut well, he was in the\\r\\nmind it was: this is called the Retort Courteous.\\r\\nIf I sent him word again 'it was not well cut,' he\\r\\nwould send me word, he cut it to please himself:\\r\\nthis is called the Quip Modest. If again 'it was\\r\\nnot well cut,' he disabled my judgment: this is\\r\\ncalled the Reply Churlish. If again 'it was not\\r\\nwell cut,' he would answer, I spake not true: this\\r\\nis called the Reproof Valiant. If again 'it was not\\r\\nwell cut,' he would say I lied: this is called the\\r\\nCounter-cheque Quarrelsome: and so to the Lie\\r\\nCircumstantial and the Lie Direct.\\r\\nJAQUES\\r\\nAnd how oft did you say his beard was not well cut?\\r\\nTOUCHSTONE\\r\\nI durst go no further than the Lie Circumstantial,\\r\\nnor he durst not give me the Lie Direct; and so we\\r\\nmeasured swords and parted.\\r\\nJAQUES\\r\\nCan you nominate in order now the degrees of the lie?\\r\\nTOUCHSTONE\\r\\nO sir, we quarrel in print, by the book; as you have\\r\\nbooks for good manners: I will name you the degrees.\\r\\nThe first, the Retort Courteous; the second, the\\r\\nQuip Modest; the third, the Reply Churlish; the\\r\\nfourth, the Reproof Valiant; the fifth, the\\r\\nCountercheque Quarrelsome; the sixth, the Lie with\\r\\nCircumstance; the seventh, the Lie Direct. All\\r\\nthese you may avoid but the Lie Direct; and you may\\r\\navoid that too, with an If. I knew when seven\\r\\njustices could not take up a quarrel, but when the\\r\\nparties were met themselves, one of them thought but\\r\\nof an If, as, 'If you said so, then I said so;' and\\r\\nthey shook hands and swore brothers. Your If is the\\r\\nonly peacemaker; much virtue in If.\\r\\nJAQUES\\r\\nIs not this a rare fellow, my lord? he's as good at\\r\\nany thing and yet a fool.\\r\\nDUKE SENIOR\\r\\nHe uses his folly like a stalking-horse and under\\r\\nthe presentation of that he shoots his wit.\\r\\nEnter HYMEN, ROSALIND, and CELIA\\r\\n\\r\\nStill Music\\r\\n\\r\\nHYMEN\\r\\nThen is there mirth in heaven,\\r\\nWhen earthly things made even\\r\\nAtone together.\\r\\nGood duke, receive thy daughter\\r\\nHymen from heaven brought her,\\r\\nYea, brought her hither,\\r\\nThat thou mightst join her hand with his\\r\\nWhose heart within his bosom is.\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\n[To DUKE SENIOR] To you I give myself, for I am yours.\\r\\nTo ORLANDO\\r\\n\\r\\nTo you I give myself, for I am yours.\\r\\nDUKE SENIOR\\r\\nIf there be truth in sight, you are my daughter.\\r\\nORLANDO\\r\\nIf there be truth in sight, you are my Rosalind.\\r\\nPHEBE\\r\\nIf sight and shape be true,\\r\\nWhy then, my love adieu!\\r\\nROSALIND\\r\\nI'll have no father, if you be not he:\\r\\nI'll have no husband, if you be not he:\\r\\nNor ne'er wed woman, if you be not she.\\r\\nHYMEN\\r\\nPeace, ho!

If it be true that good wine needs\\r\\nno bush, 'tis true that a good play needs no\\r\\nepilogue; yet to good wine they do use good bushes,\\r\\nand good plays prove the better by the help of good\\r\\nepilogues. What a case am I in then, that am\\r\\nneither a good epilogue nor cannot insinuate with\\r\\nyou in the behalf of a good play! I am not\\r\\nfurnished like a beggar, therefore to beg will not\\r\\nbecome me: my way is to conjure you; and I'll begin\\r\\nwith the women. I charge you, O women, for the love\\r\\nyou bear to men, to like as much of this play as\\r\\nplease you: and I charge you, O men, for the love\\r\\nyou bear to women--as I perceive by your simpering,\\r\\nnone of you hates them--that between you and the\\r\\nwomen the play may please. If I were a woman I\\r\\nwould kiss as many of you as had beards that pleased\\r\\nme, complexions that liked me and breaths that I\\r\\ndefied not: and, I am sure, as many as have good\\r\\nbeards or good faces or sweet breaths will, for my\\r\\nkind offer, when I make curtsy, bid me farewell.\\r\\nExeunt\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nACT I\\r\\nSCENE I.

We will give you sleepy drinks,\\r\\nthat your senses, unintelligent of our insufficience,\\r\\nmay, though they cannot praise us, as little accuse\\r\\nus.\\r\\nCAMILLO\\r\\nYou pay a great deal too dear for what's given freely.\\r\\nARCHIDAMUS\\r\\nBelieve me, I speak as my understanding instructs me\\r\\nand as mine honesty puts it to utterance.\\r\\nCAMILLO\\r\\nSicilia cannot show himself over-kind to Bohemia.\\r\\nThey were trained together in their childhoods; and\\r\\nthere rooted betwixt them then such an affection,\\r\\nwhich cannot choose but branch now. Since their\\r\\nmore mature dignities and royal necessities made\\r\\nseparation of their society, their encounters,\\r\\nthough not personal, have been royally attorneyed\\r\\nwith interchange of gifts, letters, loving\\r\\nembassies; that they have seemed to be together,\\r\\nthough absent, shook hands, as over a vast, and\\r\\nembraced, as it were, from the ends of opposed\\r\\nwinds. The heavens continue their loves!\\r\\nARCHIDAMUS\\r\\nI think there is not in the world either malice or\\r\\nmatter to alter it. You have an unspeakable\\r\\ncomfort of your young prince Mamillius: it is a\\r\\ngentleman of the greatest promise that ever came\\r\\ninto my note.\\r\\nCAMILLO\\r\\nI very well agree with you in the hopes of him: it\\r\\nis a gallant child; one that indeed physics the\\r\\nsubject, makes old hearts fresh: they that went on\\r\\ncrutches ere he was born desire yet their life to\\r\\nsee him a man.\\r\\nARCHIDAMUS\\r\\nWould they else be content to die?\\r\\nCAMILLO\\r\\nYes; if there were no other excuse why they should\\r\\ndesire to live.\\r\\nARCHIDAMUS\\r\\nIf the king had no son, they would desire to live\\r\\non crutches till he had one.\\r\\nExeunt\\r\\n\\r\\nSCENE II.

How now, boy!\\r\\nMAMILLIUS\\r\\nI am like you, they say.\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nWhy that's some comfort. What, Camillo there?\\r\\nCAMILLO\\r\\nAy, my good lord.\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nGo play, Mamillius; thou'rt an honest man.\\r\\nExit MAMILLIUS\\r\\n\\r\\nCamillo, this great sir will yet stay longer.\\r\\nCAMILLO\\r\\nYou had much ado to make his anchor hold:\\r\\nWhen you cast out, it still came home.\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nDidst note it?\\r\\nCAMILLO\\r\\nHe would not stay at your petitions: made\\r\\nHis business more material.\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nDidst perceive it?\\r\\nAside\\r\\n\\r\\nThey're here with me already, whispering, rounding\\r\\n'Sicilia is a so-forth:' 'tis far gone,\\r\\nWhen I shall gust it last. How came't, Camillo,\\r\\nThat he did stay?\\r\\nCAMILLO\\r\\nAt the good queen's entreaty.\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nAt the queen's be't: 'good' should be pertinent\\r\\nBut, so it is, it is not. Was this taken\\r\\nBy any understanding pate but thine?\\r\\nFor thy conceit is soaking, will draw in\\r\\nMore than the common blocks: not noted, is't,\\r\\nBut of the finer natures? by some severals\\r\\nOf head-piece extraordinary? lower messes\\r\\nPerchance are to this business purblind? say.\\r\\nCAMILLO\\r\\nBusiness, my lord! I think most understand\\r\\nBohemia stays here longer.\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nHa!\\r\\nCAMILLO\\r\\nStays here longer.\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nAy, but why?\\r\\nCAMILLO\\r\\nTo satisfy your highness and the entreaties\\r\\nOf our most gracious mistress.\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nSatisfy!\\r\\nThe entreaties of your mistress! satisfy!\\r\\nLet that suffice. I have trusted thee, Camillo,\\r\\nWith all the nearest things to my heart, as well\\r\\nMy chamber-councils, wherein, priest-like, thou\\r\\nHast cleansed my bosom, I from thee departed\\r\\nThy penitent reform'd: but we have been\\r\\nDeceived in thy integrity, deceived\\r\\nIn that which seems so.\\r\\nCAMILLO\\r\\nBe it forbid, my lord!\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nTo bide upon't, thou art not honest, or,\\r\\nIf thou inclinest that way, thou art a coward,\\r\\nWhich hoxes honesty behind, restraining\\r\\nFrom course required; or else thou must be counted\\r\\nA servant grafted in my serious trust\\r\\nAnd therein negligent; or else a fool\\r\\nThat seest a game play'd home, the rich stake drawn,\\r\\nAnd takest it all for jest.\\r\\nCAMILLO\\r\\nMy gracious lord,\\r\\nI may be negligent, foolish and fearful;\\r\\nIn every one of these no man is free,\\r\\nBut that his negligence, his folly, fear,\\r\\nAmong the infinite doings of the world,\\r\\nSometime puts forth. In your affairs, my lord,\\r\\nIf ever I were wilful-negligent,\\r\\nIt was my folly; if industriously\\r\\nI play'd the fool, it was my negligence,\\r\\nNot weighing well the end; if ever fearful\\r\\nTo do a thing, where I the issue doubted,\\r\\nWhere of the execution did cry out\\r\\nAgainst the non-performance, 'twas a fear\\r\\nWhich oft infects the wisest: these, my lord,\\r\\nAre such allow'd infirmities that honesty\\r\\nIs never free of. But, beseech your grace,\\r\\nBe plainer with me; let me know my trespass\\r\\nBy its own visage: if I then deny it,\\r\\n'Tis none of mine.\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nHa' not you seen, Camillo,--\\r\\nBut that's past doubt, you have, or your eye-glass\\r\\nIs thicker than a cuckold's horn,--or heard,--\\r\\nFor to a vision so apparent rumour\\r\\nCannot be mute,--or thought,--for cogitation\\r\\nResides not in that man that does not think,--\\r\\nMy wife is slippery? If thou wilt confess,\\r\\nOr else be impudently negative,\\r\\nTo have nor eyes nor ears nor thought, then say\\r\\nMy wife's a hobby-horse, deserves a name\\r\\nAs rank as any flax-wench that puts to\\r\\nBefore her troth-plight: say't and justify't.\\r\\nCAMILLO\\r\\nI would not be a stander-by to hear\\r\\nMy sovereign mistress clouded so, without\\r\\nMy present vengeance taken: 'shrew my heart,\\r\\nYou never spoke what did become you less\\r\\nThan this; which to reiterate were sin\\r\\nAs deep as that, though true.\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nIs whispering nothing?\\r\\nIs leaning cheek to cheek? is meeting noses?\\r\\nKissing with inside lip? stopping the career\\r\\nOf laughing with a sigh?--a note infallible\\r\\nOf breaking honesty--horsing foot on foot?\\r\\nSkulking in corners? wishing clocks more swift?\\r\\nHours, minutes? noon, midnight? and all eyes\\r\\nBlind with the pin and web but theirs, theirs only,\\r\\nThat would unseen be wicked? is this nothing?\\r\\nWhy, then the world and all that's in't is nothing;\\r\\nThe covering sky is nothing; Bohemia nothing;\\r\\nMy wife is nothing; nor nothing have these nothings,\\r\\nIf this be nothing.\\r\\nCAMILLO\\r\\nGood my lord, be cured\\r\\nOf this diseased opinion, and betimes;\\r\\nFor 'tis most dangerous.\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nSay it be, 'tis true.\\r\\nCAMILLO\\r\\nNo, no, my lord.\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nIt is; you lie, you lie:\\r\\nI say thou liest, Camillo, and I hate thee,\\r\\nPronounce thee a gross lout, a mindless slave,\\r\\nOr else a hovering temporizer, that\\r\\nCanst with thine eyes at once see good and evil,\\r\\nInclining to them both: were my wife's liver\\r\\nInfected as her life, she would not live\\r\\nThe running of one glass.\\r\\nCAMILLO\\r\\nWho does infect her?\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nWhy, he that wears her like a medal, hanging\\r\\nAbout his neck, Bohemia: who, if I\\r\\nHad servants true about me, that bare eyes\\r\\nTo see alike mine honour as their profits,\\r\\nTheir own particular thrifts, they would do that\\r\\nWhich should undo more doing: ay, and thou,\\r\\nHis cupbearer,--whom I from meaner form\\r\\nHave benched and reared to worship, who mayst see\\r\\nPlainly as heaven sees earth and earth sees heaven,\\r\\nHow I am galled,--mightst bespice a cup,\\r\\nTo give mine enemy a lasting wink;\\r\\nWhich draught to me were cordial.\\r\\nCAMILLO\\r\\nSir, my lord,\\r\\nI could do this, and that with no rash potion,\\r\\nBut with a lingering dram that should not work\\r\\nMaliciously like poison: but I cannot\\r\\nBelieve this crack to be in my dread mistress,\\r\\nSo sovereignly being honourable.\\r\\nI have loved thee,--\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nMake that thy question, and go rot!\\r\\nDost think I am so muddy, so unsettled,\\r\\nTo appoint myself in this vexation, sully\\r\\nThe purity and whiteness of my sheets,\\r\\nWhich to preserve is sleep, which being spotted\\r\\nIs goads, thorns, nettles, tails of wasps,\\r\\nGive scandal to the blood o' the prince my son,\\r\\nWho I do think is mine and love as mine,\\r\\nWithout ripe moving to't? Would I do this?\\r\\nCould man so blench?\\r\\nCAMILLO\\r\\nI must believe you, sir:\\r\\nI do; and will fetch off Bohemia for't;\\r\\nProvided that, when he's removed, your highness\\r\\nWill take again your queen as yours at first,\\r\\nEven for your son's sake; and thereby for sealing\\r\\nThe injury of tongues in courts and kingdoms\\r\\nKnown and allied to yours.\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nThou dost advise me\\r\\nEven so as I mine own course have set down:\\r\\nI'll give no blemish to her honour, none.\\r\\nCAMILLO\\r\\nMy lord,\\r\\nGo then; and with a countenance as clear\\r\\nAs friendship wears at feasts, keep with Bohemia\\r\\nAnd with your queen. I am his cupbearer:\\r\\nIf from me he have wholesome beverage,\\r\\nAccount me not your servant.\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nThis is all:\\r\\nDo't and thou hast the one half of my heart;\\r\\nDo't not, thou split'st thine own.\\r\\nCAMILLO\\r\\nI'll do't, my lord.\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nI will seem friendly, as thou hast advised me.\\r\\nExit\\r\\n\\r\\nCAMILLO\\r\\nO miserable lady! But, for me,\\r\\nWhat case stand I in? I must be the poisoner\\r\\nOf good Polixenes; and my ground to do't\\r\\nIs the obedience to a master, one\\r\\nWho in rebellion with himself will have\\r\\nAll that are his so too. To do this deed,\\r\\nPromotion follows. If I could find example\\r\\nOf thousands that had struck anointed kings\\r\\nAnd flourish'd after, I'ld not do't; but since\\r\\nNor brass nor stone nor parchment bears not one,\\r\\nLet villany itself forswear't. I must\\r\\nForsake the court: to do't, or no, is certain\\r\\nTo me a break-neck. Happy star, reign now!\\r\\nHere comes Bohemia.\\r\\nRe-enter POLIXENES\\r\\n\\r\\nPOLIXENES\\r\\nThis is strange: methinks\\r\\nMy favour here begins to warp. Not speak?\\r\\nGood day, Camillo.\\r\\nCAMILLO\\r\\nHail, most royal sir!\\r\\nPOLIXENES\\r\\nWhat is the news i' the court?\\r\\nCAMILLO\\r\\nNone rare, my lord.\\r\\nPOLIXENES\\r\\nThe king hath on him such a countenance\\r\\nAs he had lost some province and a region\\r\\nLoved as he loves himself: even now I met him\\r\\nWith customary compliment; when he,\\r\\nWafting his eyes to the contrary and falling\\r\\nA lip of much contempt, speeds from me and\\r\\nSo leaves me to consider what is breeding\\r\\nThat changeth thus his manners.\\r\\nCAMILLO\\r\\nI dare not know, my lord.\\r\\nPOLIXENES\\r\\nHow! dare not! do not. Do you know, and dare not?\\r\\nBe intelligent to me: 'tis thereabouts;\\r\\nFor, to yourself, what you do know, you must.\\r\\nAnd cannot say, you dare not. Good Camillo,\\r\\nYour changed complexions are to me a mirror\\r\\nWhich shows me mine changed too; for I must be\\r\\nA party in this alteration, finding\\r\\nMyself thus alter'd with 't.\\r\\nCAMILLO\\r\\nThere is a sickness\\r\\nWhich puts some of us in distemper, but\\r\\nI cannot name the disease; and it is caught\\r\\nOf you that yet are well.\\r\\nPOLIXENES\\r\\nHow! caught of me!\\r\\nMake me not sighted like the basilisk:\\r\\nI have look'd on thousands, who have sped the better\\r\\nBy my regard, but kill'd none so. Camillo,--\\r\\nAs you are certainly a gentleman, thereto\\r\\nClerk-like experienced, which no less adorns\\r\\nOur gentry than our parents' noble names,\\r\\nIn whose success we are gentle,--I beseech you,\\r\\nIf you know aught which does behove my knowledge\\r\\nThereof to be inform'd, imprison't not\\r\\nIn ignorant concealment.\\r\\nCAMILLO\\r\\nI may not answer.\\r\\nPOLIXENES\\r\\nA sickness caught of me, and yet I well!\\r\\nI must be answer'd. Dost thou hear, Camillo,\\r\\nI conjure thee, by all the parts of man\\r\\nWhich honour does acknowledge, whereof the least\\r\\nIs not this suit of mine, that thou declare\\r\\nWhat incidency thou dost guess of harm\\r\\nIs creeping toward me; how far off, how near;\\r\\nWhich way to be prevented, if to be;\\r\\nIf not, how best to bear it.\\r\\nCAMILLO\\r\\nSir, I will tell you;\\r\\nSince I am charged in honour and by him\\r\\nThat I think honourable: therefore mark my counsel,\\r\\nWhich must be even as swiftly follow'd as\\r\\nI mean to utter it, or both yourself and me\\r\\nCry lost, and so good night!\\r\\nPOLIXENES\\r\\nOn, good Camillo.\\r\\nCAMILLO\\r\\nI am appointed him to murder you.\\r\\nPOLIXENES\\r\\nBy whom, Camillo?\\r\\nCAMILLO\\r\\nBy the king.\\r\\nPOLIXENES\\r\\nFor what?\\r\\nCAMILLO\\r\\nHe thinks, nay, with all confidence he swears,\\r\\nAs he had seen't or been an instrument\\r\\nTo vice you to't, that you have touch'd his queen\\r\\nForbiddenly.\\r\\nPOLIXENES\\r\\nO, then my best blood turn\\r\\nTo an infected jelly and my name\\r\\nBe yoked with his that did betray the Best!\\r\\nTurn then my freshest reputation to\\r\\nA savour that may strike the dullest nostril\\r\\nWhere I arrive, and my approach be shunn'd,\\r\\nNay, hated too, worse than the great'st infection\\r\\nThat e'er was heard or read!\\r\\nCAMILLO\\r\\nSwear his thought over\\r\\nBy each particular star in heaven and\\r\\nBy all their influences, you may as well\\r\\nForbid the sea for to obey the moon\\r\\nAs or by oath remove or counsel shake\\r\\nThe fabric of his folly, whose foundation\\r\\nIs piled upon his faith and will continue\\r\\nThe standing of his body.\\r\\nPOLIXENES\\r\\nHow should this grow?\\r\\nCAMILLO\\r\\nI know not: but I am sure 'tis safer to\\r\\nAvoid what's grown than question how 'tis born.\\r\\nIf therefore you dare trust my honesty,\\r\\nThat lies enclosed in this trunk which you\\r\\nShall bear along impawn'd, away to-night!\\r\\nYour followers I will whisper to the business,\\r\\nAnd will by twos and threes at several posterns\\r\\nClear them o' the city. For myself, I'll put\\r\\nMy fortunes to your service, which are here\\r\\nBy this discovery lost. Be not uncertain;\\r\\nFor, by the honour of my parents, I\\r\\nHave utter'd truth: which if you seek to prove,\\r\\nI dare not stand by; nor shall you be safer\\r\\nThan one condemn'd by the king's own mouth, thereon\\r\\nHis execution sworn.\\r\\nPOLIXENES\\r\\nI do believe thee:\\r\\nI saw his heart in 's face. Give me thy hand:\\r\\nBe pilot to me and thy places shall\\r\\nStill neighbour mine. My ships are ready and\\r\\nMy people did expect my hence departure\\r\\nTwo days ago. This jealousy\\r\\nIs for a precious creature: as she's rare,\\r\\nMust it be great, and as his person's mighty,\\r\\nMust it be violent, and as he does conceive\\r\\nHe is dishonour'd by a man which ever\\r\\nProfess'd to him, why, his revenges must\\r\\nIn that be made more bitter. Fear o'ershades me:\\r\\nGood expedition be my friend, and comfort\\r\\nThe gracious queen, part of his theme, but nothing\\r\\nOf his ill-ta'en suspicion! Come, Camillo;\\r\\nI will respect thee as a father if\\r\\nThou bear'st my life off hence: let us avoid.\\r\\nCAMILLO\\r\\nIt is in mine authority to command\\r\\nThe keys of all the posterns: please your highness\\r\\nTo take the urgent hour. Come, sir, away.\\r\\nExeunt\\r\\n\\r\\nACT II\\r\\nSCENE I. A room in LEONTES' palace.\\r\\nEnter HERMIONE, MAMILLIUS, and Ladies\\r\\nHERMIONE\\r\\nTake the boy to you: he so troubles me,\\r\\n'Tis past enduring.\\r\\nFirst Lady\\r\\nCome, my gracious lord,\\r\\nShall I be your playfellow?\\r\\nMAMILLIUS\\r\\nNo, I'll none of you.\\r\\nFirst Lady\\r\\nWhy, my sweet lord?\\r\\nMAMILLIUS\\r\\nYou'll kiss me hard and speak to me as if\\r\\nI were a baby still. I love you better.\\r\\nSecond Lady\\r\\nAnd why so, my lord?\\r\\nMAMILLIUS\\r\\nNot for because\\r\\nYour brows are blacker; yet black brows, they say,\\r\\nBecome some women best, so that there be not\\r\\nToo much hair there, but in a semicircle\\r\\nOr a half-moon made with a pen.\\r\\nSecond Lady\\r\\nWho taught you this?\\r\\nMAMILLIUS\\r\\nI learnt it out of women's faces. Pray now\\r\\nWhat colour are your eyebrows?\\r\\nFirst Lady\\r\\nBlue, my lord.\\r\\nMAMILLIUS\\r\\nNay, that's a mock: I have seen a lady's nose\\r\\nThat has been blue, but not her eyebrows.\\r\\nFirst Lady\\r\\nHark ye;\\r\\nThe queen your mother rounds apace: we shall\\r\\nPresent our services to a fine new prince\\r\\nOne of these days; and then you'ld wanton with us,\\r\\nIf we would have you.\\r\\nSecond Lady\\r\\nShe is spread of late\\r\\nInto a goodly bulk: good time encounter her!\\r\\nHERMIONE\\r\\nWhat wisdom stirs amongst you? Come, sir, now\\r\\nI am for you again: pray you, sit by us,\\r\\nAnd tell 's a tale.\\r\\nMAMILLIUS\\r\\nMerry or sad shall't be?\\r\\nHERMIONE\\r\\nAs merry as you will.\\r\\nMAMILLIUS\\r\\nA sad tale's best for winter: I have one\\r\\nOf sprites and goblins.\\r\\nHERMIONE\\r\\nLet's have that, good sir.\\r\\nCome on, sit down: come on, and do your best\\r\\nTo fright me with your sprites; you're powerful at it.\\r\\nMAMILLIUS\\r\\nThere was a man--\\r\\nHERMIONE\\r\\nNay, come, sit down; then on.\\r\\nMAMILLIUS\\r\\nDwelt by a churchyard: I will tell it softly;\\r\\nYond crickets shall not hear it.\\r\\nHERMIONE\\r\\nCome on, then,\\r\\nAnd give't me in mine ear.\\r\\nEnter LEONTES, with ANTIGONUS, Lords and others\\r\\n\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nWas he met there? his train? Camillo with him?\\r\\nFirst Lord\\r\\nBehind the tuft of pines I met them; never\\r\\nSaw I men scour so on their way: I eyed them\\r\\nEven to their ships.\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nHow blest am I\\r\\nIn my just censure, in my true opinion!\\r\\nAlack, for lesser knowledge! how accursed\\r\\nIn being so blest! There may be in the cup\\r\\nA spider steep'd, and one may drink, depart,\\r\\nAnd yet partake no venom, for his knowledge\\r\\nIs not infected: but if one present\\r\\nThe abhorr'd ingredient to his eye, make known\\r\\nHow he hath drunk, he cracks his gorge, his sides,\\r\\nWith violent hefts. I have drunk,\\r\\nand seen the spider.\\r\\nCamillo was his help in this, his pander:\\r\\nThere is a plot against my life, my crown;\\r\\nAll's true that is mistrusted: that false villain\\r\\nWhom I employ'd was pre-employ'd by him:\\r\\nHe has discover'd my design, and I\\r\\nRemain a pinch'd thing; yea, a very trick\\r\\nFor them to play at will. How came the posterns\\r\\nSo easily open?\\r\\nFirst Lord\\r\\nBy his great authority;\\r\\nWhich often hath no less prevail'd than so\\r\\nOn your command.\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nI know't too well.\\r\\nGive me the boy: I am glad you did not nurse him:\\r\\nThough he does bear some signs of me, yet you\\r\\nHave too much blood in him.\\r\\nHERMIONE\\r\\nWhat is this? sport?\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nBear the boy hence; he shall not come about her;\\r\\nAway with him! and let her sport herself\\r\\nWith that she's big with; for 'tis Polixenes\\r\\nHas made thee swell thus.\\r\\nHERMIONE\\r\\nBut I'ld say he had not,\\r\\nAnd I'll be sworn you would believe my saying,\\r\\nHowe'er you lean to the nayward.\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nYou, my lords,\\r\\nLook on her, mark her well; be but about\\r\\nTo say 'she is a goodly lady,' and\\r\\nThe justice of your bearts will thereto add\\r\\n'Tis pity she's not honest, honourable:'\\r\\nPraise her but for this her without-door form,\\r\\nWhich on my faith deserves high speech, and straight\\r\\nThe shrug, the hum or ha, these petty brands\\r\\nThat calumny doth use--O, I am out--\\r\\nThat mercy does, for calumny will sear\\r\\nVirtue itself: these shrugs, these hums and ha's,\\r\\nWhen you have said 'she's goodly,' come between\\r\\nEre you can say 'she's honest:' but be 't known,\\r\\nFrom him that has most cause to grieve it should be,\\r\\nShe's an adulteress.\\r\\nHERMIONE\\r\\nShould a villain say so,\\r\\nThe most replenish'd villain in the world,\\r\\nHe were as much more villain: you, my lord,\\r\\nDo but mistake.\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nYou have mistook, my lady,\\r\\nPolixenes for Leontes: O thou thing!\\r\\nWhich I'll not call a creature of thy place,\\r\\nLest barbarism, making me the precedent,\\r\\nShould a like language use to all degrees\\r\\nAnd mannerly distinguishment leave out\\r\\nBetwixt the prince and beggar: I have said\\r\\nShe's an adulteress; I have said with whom:\\r\\nMore, she's a traitor and Camillo is\\r\\nA federary with her, and one that knows\\r\\nWhat she should shame to know herself\\r\\nBut with her most vile principal, that she's\\r\\nA bed-swerver, even as bad as those\\r\\nThat vulgars give bold'st titles, ay, and privy\\r\\nTo this their late escape.\\r\\nHERMIONE\\r\\nNo, by my life.\\r\\nPrivy to none of this. How will this grieve you,\\r\\nWhen you shall come to clearer knowledge, that\\r\\nYou thus have publish'd me! Gentle my lord,\\r\\nYou scarce can right me throughly then to say\\r\\nYou did mistake.\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nNo; if I mistake\\r\\nIn those foundations which I build upon,\\r\\nThe centre is not big enough to bear\\r\\nA school-boy's top. Away with her! to prison!\\r\\nHe who shall speak for her is afar off guilty\\r\\nBut that he speaks.\\r\\nHERMIONE\\r\\nThere's some ill planet reigns:\\r\\nI must be patient till the heavens look\\r\\nWith an aspect more favourable. Good my lords,\\r\\nI am not prone to weeping, as our sex\\r\\nCommonly are; the want of which vain dew\\r\\nPerchance shall dry your pities: but I have\\r\\nThat honourable grief lodged here which burns\\r\\nWorse than tears drown: beseech you all, my lords,\\r\\nWith thoughts so qualified as your charities\\r\\nShall best instruct you, measure me; and so\\r\\nThe king's will be perform'd!\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nShall I be heard?\\r\\nHERMIONE\\r\\nWho is't that goes with me? Beseech your highness,\\r\\nMy women may be with me; for you see\\r\\nMy plight requires it. Do not weep, good fools;\\r\\nThere is no cause: when you shall know your mistress\\r\\nHas deserved prison, then abound in tears\\r\\nAs I come out: this action I now go on\\r\\nIs for my better grace. Adieu, my lord:\\r\\nI never wish'd to see you sorry; now\\r\\nI trust I shall. My women, come; you have leave.\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nGo, do our bidding; hence!\\r\\nExit HERMIONE, guarded; with Ladies\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst Lord\\r\\nBeseech your highness, call the queen again.\\r\\nANTIGONUS\\r\\nBe certain what you do, sir, lest your justice\\r\\nProve violence; in the which three great ones suffer,\\r\\nYourself, your queen, your son.\\r\\nFirst Lord\\r\\nFor her, my lord,\\r\\nI dare my life lay down and will do't, sir,\\r\\nPlease you to accept it, that the queen is spotless\\r\\nI' the eyes of heaven and to you; I mean,\\r\\nIn this which you accuse her.\\r\\nANTIGONUS\\r\\nIf it prove\\r\\nShe's otherwise, I'll keep my stables where\\r\\nI lodge my wife; I'll go in couples with her;\\r\\nThan when I feel and see her no farther trust her;\\r\\nFor every inch of woman in the world,\\r\\nAy, every dram of woman's flesh is false, If she be.\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nHold your peaces.\\r\\nFirst Lord\\r\\nGood my lord,--\\r\\nANTIGONUS\\r\\nIt is for you we speak, not for ourselves:\\r\\nYou are abused and by some putter-on\\r\\nThat will be damn'd for't; would I knew the villain,\\r\\nI would land-damn him. Be she honour-flaw'd,\\r\\nI have three daughters; the eldest is eleven\\r\\nThe second and the third, nine, and some five;\\r\\nIf this prove true, they'll pay for't:\\r\\nby mine honour,\\r\\nI'll geld 'em all; fourteen they shall not see,\\r\\nTo bring false generations: they are co-heirs;\\r\\nAnd I had rather glib myself than they\\r\\nShould not produce fair issue.\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nCease; no more.\\r\\nYou smell this business with a sense as cold\\r\\nAs is a dead man's nose: but I do see't and feel't\\r\\nAs you feel doing thus; and see withal\\r\\nThe instruments that feel.\\r\\nANTIGONUS\\r\\nIf it be so,\\r\\nWe need no grave to bury honesty:\\r\\nThere's not a grain of it the face to sweeten\\r\\nOf the whole dungy earth.\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nWhat! lack I credit?\\r\\nFirst Lord\\r\\nI had rather you did lack than I, my lord,\\r\\nUpon this ground; and more it would content me\\r\\nTo have her honour true than your suspicion,\\r\\nBe blamed for't how you might.\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nWhy, what need we\\r\\nCommune with you of this, but rather follow\\r\\nOur forceful instigation? Our prerogative\\r\\nCalls not your counsels, but our natural goodness\\r\\nImparts this; which if you, or stupefied\\r\\nOr seeming so in skill, cannot or will not\\r\\nRelish a truth like us, inform yourselves\\r\\nWe need no more of your advice: the matter,\\r\\nThe loss, the gain, the ordering on't, is all\\r\\nProperly ours.\\r\\nANTIGONUS\\r\\nAnd I wish, my liege,\\r\\nYou had only in your silent judgment tried it,\\r\\nWithout more overture.\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nHow could that be?\\r\\nEither thou art most ignorant by age,\\r\\nOr thou wert born a fool. Camillo's flight,\\r\\nAdded to their familiarity,\\r\\nWhich was as gross as ever touch'd conjecture,\\r\\nThat lack'd sight only, nought for approbation\\r\\nBut only seeing, all other circumstances\\r\\nMade up to the deed, doth push on this proceeding:\\r\\nYet, for a greater confirmation,\\r\\nFor in an act of this importance 'twere\\r\\nMost piteous to be wild, I have dispatch'd in post\\r\\nTo sacred Delphos, to Apollo's temple,\\r\\nCleomenes and Dion, whom you know\\r\\nOf stuff'd sufficiency: now from the oracle\\r\\nThey will bring all; whose spiritual counsel had,\\r\\nShall stop or spur me. Have I done well?\\r\\nFirst Lord\\r\\nWell done, my lord.\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nThough I am satisfied and need no more\\r\\nThan what I know, yet shall the oracle\\r\\nGive rest to the minds of others, such as he\\r\\nWhose ignorant credulity will not\\r\\nCome up to the truth. So have we thought it good\\r\\nFrom our free person she should be confined,\\r\\nLest that the treachery of the two fled hence\\r\\nBe left her to perform. Come, follow us;\\r\\nWe are to speak in public; for this business\\r\\nWill raise us all.\\r\\nANTIGONUS\\r\\n[Aside]\\r\\nTo laughter, as I take it,\\r\\nIf the good truth were known.\\r\\nExeunt\\r\\n\\r\\nSCENE II.

Emilia?\\r\\nGaoler\\r\\nSo please you, madam,\\r\\nTo put apart these your attendants, I\\r\\nShall bring Emilia forth.\\r\\nPAULINA\\r\\nI pray now, call her.\\r\\nWithdraw yourselves.\\r\\nExeunt Gentleman and Attendants\\r\\n\\r\\nGaoler\\r\\nAnd, madam,\\r\\nI must be present at your conference.\\r\\nPAULINA\\r\\nWell, be't so, prithee.\\r\\nExit Gaoler\\r\\n\\r\\nHere's such ado to make no stain a stain\\r\\nAs passes colouring.\\r\\nRe-enter Gaoler, with EMILIA\\r\\n\\r\\nDear gentlewoman,\\r\\nHow fares our gracious lady?\\r\\nEMILIA\\r\\nAs well as one so great and so forlorn\\r\\nMay hold together: on her frights and griefs,\\r\\nWhich never tender lady hath born greater,\\r\\nShe is something before her time deliver'd.\\r\\nPAULINA\\r\\nA boy?\\r\\nEMILIA\\r\\nA daughter, and a goodly babe,\\r\\nLusty and like to live: the queen receives\\r\\nMuch comfort in't; says 'My poor prisoner,\\r\\nI am innocent as you.'\\r\\nPAULINA\\r\\nI dare be sworn\\r\\nThese dangerous unsafe lunes i' the king,\\r\\nbeshrew them!\\r\\nHe must be told on't, and he shall: the office\\r\\nBecomes a woman best; I'll take't upon me:\\r\\nIf I prove honey-mouth'd let my tongue blister\\r\\nAnd never to my red-look'd anger be\\r\\nThe trumpet any more. Pray you, Emilia,\\r\\nCommend my best obedience to the queen:\\r\\nIf she dares trust me with her little babe,\\r\\nI'll show't the king and undertake to be\\r\\nHer advocate to the loud'st. We do not know\\r\\nHow he may soften at the sight o' the child:\\r\\nThe silence often of pure innocence\\r\\nPersuades when speaking fails.\\r\\nEMILIA\\r\\nMost worthy madam,\\r\\nYour honour and your goodness is so evident\\r\\nThat your free undertaking cannot miss\\r\\nA thriving issue: there is no lady living\\r\\nSo meet for this great errand. Please your ladyship\\r\\nTo visit the next room, I'll presently\\r\\nAcquaint the queen of your most noble offer;\\r\\nWho but to-day hammer'd of this design,\\r\\nBut durst not tempt a minister of honour,\\r\\nLest she should be denied.\\r\\nPAULINA\\r\\nTell her, Emilia.\\r\\nI'll use that tongue I have: if wit flow from't\\r\\nAs boldness from my bosom, let 't not be doubted\\r\\nI shall do good.\\r\\nEMILIA\\r\\nNow be you blest for it!\\r\\nI'll to the queen: please you,\\r\\ncome something nearer.\\r\\nGaoler\\r\\nMadam, if't please the queen to send the babe,\\r\\nI know not what I shall incur to pass it,\\r\\nHaving no warrant.\\r\\nPAULINA\\r\\nYou need not fear it, sir:\\r\\nThis child was prisoner to the womb and is\\r\\nBy law and process of great nature thence\\r\\nFreed and enfranchised, not a party to\\r\\nThe anger of the king nor guilty of,\\r\\nIf any be, the trespass of the queen.\\r\\nGaoler\\r\\nI do believe it.\\r\\nPAULINA\\r\\nDo not you fear: upon mine honour,\\r\\nI will stand betwixt you and danger.\\r\\nExeunt\\r\\n\\r\\nSCENE III. A room in LEONTES' palace.\\r\\nEnter LEONTES, ANTIGONUS, Lords, and Servants\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nNor night nor day no rest: it is but weakness\\r\\nTo bear the matter thus; mere weakness. If\\r\\nThe cause were not in being,--part o' the cause,\\r\\nShe the adulteress; for the harlot king\\r\\nIs quite beyond mine arm, out of the blank\\r\\nAnd level of my brain, plot-proof; but she\\r\\nI can hook to me: say that she were gone,\\r\\nGiven to the fire, a moiety of my rest\\r\\nMight come to me again. Who's there?\\r\\nFirst Servant\\r\\nMy lord?\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nHow does the boy?\\r\\nFirst Servant\\r\\nHe took good rest to-night;\\r\\n'Tis hoped his sickness is discharged.\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nTo see his nobleness!\\r\\nConceiving the dishonour of his mother,\\r\\nHe straight declined, droop'd, took it deeply,\\r\\nFasten'd and fix'd the shame on't in himself,\\r\\nThrew off his spirit, his appetite, his sleep,\\r\\nAnd downright languish'd. Leave me solely: go,\\r\\nSee how he fares.\\r\\nExit Servant\\r\\n\\r\\nFie, fie! no thought of him:\\r\\nThe thought of my revenges that way\\r\\nRecoil upon me: in himself too mighty,\\r\\nAnd in his parties, his alliance; let him be\\r\\nUntil a time may serve: for present vengeance,\\r\\nTake it on her. Camillo and Polixenes\\r\\nLaugh at me, make their pastime at my sorrow:\\r\\nThey should not laugh if I could reach them, nor\\r\\nShall she within my power.\\r\\nEnter PAULINA, with a child\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst Lord\\r\\nYou must not enter.\\r\\nPAULINA\\r\\nNay, rather, good my lords, be second to me:\\r\\nFear you his tyrannous passion more, alas,\\r\\nThan the queen's life? a gracious innocent soul,\\r\\nMore free than he is jealous.\\r\\nANTIGONUS\\r\\nThat's enough.\\r\\nSecond Servant\\r\\nMadam, he hath not slept tonight; commanded\\r\\nNone should come at him.\\r\\nPAULINA\\r\\nNot so hot, good sir:\\r\\nI come to bring him sleep. 'Tis such as you,\\r\\nThat creep like shadows by him and do sigh\\r\\nAt each his needless heavings, such as you\\r\\nNourish the cause of his awaking: I\\r\\nDo come with words as medicinal as true,\\r\\nHonest as either, to purge him of that humour\\r\\nThat presses him from sleep.\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nWhat noise there, ho?\\r\\nPAULINA\\r\\nNo noise, my lord; but needful conference\\r\\nAbout some gossips for your highness.\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nHow!\\r\\nAway with that audacious lady! Antigonus,\\r\\nI charged thee that she should not come about me:\\r\\nI knew she would.\\r\\nANTIGONUS\\r\\nI told her so, my lord,\\r\\nOn your displeasure's peril and on mine,\\r\\nShe should not visit you.\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nWhat, canst not rule her?\\r\\nPAULINA\\r\\nFrom all dishonesty he can: in this,\\r\\nUnless he take the course that you have done,\\r\\nCommit me for committing honour, trust it,\\r\\nHe shall not rule me.\\r\\nANTIGONUS\\r\\nLa you now, you hear:\\r\\nWhen she will take the rein I let her run;\\r\\nBut she'll not stumble.\\r\\nPAULINA\\r\\nGood my liege, I come;\\r\\nAnd, I beseech you, hear me, who profess\\r\\nMyself your loyal servant, your physician,\\r\\nYour most obedient counsellor, yet that dare\\r\\nLess appear so in comforting your evils,\\r\\nThan such as most seem yours: I say, I come\\r\\nFrom your good queen.\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nGood queen!\\r\\nPAULINA\\r\\nGood queen, my lord,\\r\\nGood queen; I say good queen;\\r\\nAnd would by combat make her good, so were I\\r\\nA man, the worst about you.\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nForce her hence.\\r\\nPAULINA\\r\\nLet him that makes but trifles of his eyes\\r\\nFirst hand me: on mine own accord I'll off;\\r\\nBut first I'll do my errand. The good queen,\\r\\nFor she is good, hath brought you forth a daughter;\\r\\nHere 'tis; commends it to your blessing.\\r\\nLaying down the child\\r\\n\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nOut!\\r\\nA mankind witch! Hence with her, out o' door:\\r\\nA most intelligencing bawd!\\r\\nPAULINA\\r\\nNot so:\\r\\nI am as ignorant in that as you\\r\\nIn so entitling me, and no less honest\\r\\nThan you are mad; which is enough, I'll warrant,\\r\\nAs this world goes, to pass for honest.\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nTraitors!\\r\\nWill you not push her out? Give her the bastard.\\r\\nThou dotard! thou art woman-tired, unroosted\\r\\nBy thy dame Partlet here. Take up the bastard;\\r\\nTake't up, I say; give't to thy crone.\\r\\nPAULINA\\r\\nFor ever\\r\\nUnvenerable be thy hands, if thou\\r\\nTakest up the princess by that forced baseness\\r\\nWhich he has put upon't!\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nHe dreads his wife.\\r\\nPAULINA\\r\\nSo I would you did; then 'twere past all doubt\\r\\nYou'ld call your children yours.\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nA nest of traitors!\\r\\nANTIGONUS\\r\\nI am none, by this good light.\\r\\nPAULINA\\r\\nNor I, nor any\\r\\nBut one that's here, and that's himself, for he\\r\\nThe sacred honour of himself, his queen's,\\r\\nHis hopeful son's, his babe's, betrays to slander,\\r\\nWhose sting is sharper than the sword's;\\r\\nand will not--\\r\\nFor, as the case now stands, it is a curse\\r\\nHe cannot be compell'd to't--once remove\\r\\nThe root of his opinion, which is rotten\\r\\nAs ever oak or stone was sound.\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nA callat\\r\\nOf boundless tongue, who late hath beat her husband\\r\\nAnd now baits me! This brat is none of mine;\\r\\nIt is the issue of Polixenes:\\r\\nHence with it, and together with the dam\\r\\nCommit them to the fire!\\r\\nPAULINA\\r\\nIt is yours;\\r\\nAnd, might we lay the old proverb to your charge,\\r\\nSo like you, 'tis the worse. Behold, my lords,\\r\\nAlthough the print be little, the whole matter\\r\\nAnd copy of the father, eye, nose, lip,\\r\\nThe trick of's frown, his forehead, nay, the valley,\\r\\nThe pretty dimples of his chin and cheek,\\r\\nHis smiles,\\r\\nThe very mould and frame of hand, nail, finger:\\r\\nAnd thou, good goddess Nature, which hast made it\\r\\nSo like to him that got it, if thou hast\\r\\nThe ordering of the mind too, 'mongst all colours\\r\\nNo yellow in't, lest she suspect, as he does,\\r\\nHer children not her husband's!\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nA gross hag\\r\\nAnd, lozel, thou art worthy to be hang'd,\\r\\nThat wilt not stay her tongue.\\r\\nANTIGONUS\\r\\nHang all the husbands\\r\\nThat cannot do that feat, you'll leave yourself\\r\\nHardly one subject.\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nOnce more, take her hence.\\r\\nPAULINA\\r\\nA most unworthy and unnatural lord\\r\\nCan do no more.\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nI'll ha' thee burnt.\\r\\nPAULINA\\r\\nI care not:\\r\\nIt is an heretic that makes the fire,\\r\\nNot she which burns in't. I'll not call you tyrant;\\r\\nBut this most cruel usage of your queen,\\r\\nNot able to produce more accusation\\r\\nThan your own weak-hinged fancy, something savours\\r\\nOf tyranny and will ignoble make you,\\r\\nYea, scandalous to the world.\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nOn your allegiance,\\r\\nOut of the chamber with her! Were I a tyrant,\\r\\nWhere were her life? she durst not call me so,\\r\\nIf she did know me one. Away with her!\\r\\nPAULINA\\r\\nI pray you, do not push me; I'll be gone.\\r\\nLook to your babe, my lord; 'tis yours:\\r\\nJove send her\\r\\nA better guiding spirit! What needs these hands?\\r\\nYou, that are thus so tender o'er his follies,\\r\\nWill never do him good, not one of you.\\r\\nSo, so: farewell; we are gone.\\r\\nExit\\r\\n\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nThou, traitor, hast set on thy wife to this.\\r\\nMy child? away with't! Even thou, that hast\\r\\nA heart so tender o'er it, take it hence\\r\\nAnd see it instantly consumed with fire;\\r\\nEven thou and none but thou. Take it up straight:\\r\\nWithin this hour bring me word 'tis done,\\r\\nAnd by good testimony, or I'll seize thy life,\\r\\nWith what thou else call'st thine. If thou refuse\\r\\nAnd wilt encounter with my wrath, say so;\\r\\nThe bastard brains with these my proper hands\\r\\nShall I dash out. Go, take it to the fire;\\r\\nFor thou set'st on thy wife.\\r\\nANTIGONUS\\r\\nI did not, sir:\\r\\nThese lords, my noble fellows, if they please,\\r\\nCan clear me in't.\\r\\nLords\\r\\nWe can: my royal liege,\\r\\nHe is not guilty of her coming hither.\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nYou're liars all.\\r\\nFirst Lord\\r\\nBeseech your highness, give us better credit:\\r\\nWe have always truly served you, and beseech you\\r\\nSo to esteem of us, and on our knees we beg,\\r\\nAs recompense of our dear services\\r\\nPast and to come, that you do change this purpose,\\r\\nWhich being so horrible, so bloody, must\\r\\nLead on to some foul issue: we all kneel.\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nI am a feather for each wind that blows:\\r\\nShall I live on to see this bastard kneel\\r\\nAnd call me father? better burn it now\\r\\nThan curse it then. But be it; let it live.\\r\\nIt shall not neither. You, sir, come you hither;\\r\\nYou that have been so tenderly officious\\r\\nWith Lady Margery, your midwife there,\\r\\nTo save this bastard's life,--for 'tis a bastard,\\r\\nSo sure as this beard's grey,\\r\\n--what will you adventure\\r\\nTo save this brat's life?\\r\\nANTIGONUS\\r\\nAny thing, my lord,\\r\\nThat my ability may undergo\\r\\nAnd nobleness impose: at least thus much:\\r\\nI'll pawn the little blood which I have left\\r\\nTo save the innocent: any thing possible.\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nIt shall be possible. Swear by this sword\\r\\nThou wilt perform my bidding.\\r\\nANTIGONUS\\r\\nI will, my lord.\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nMark and perform it, see'st thou! for the fail\\r\\nOf any point in't shall not only be\\r\\nDeath to thyself but to thy lewd-tongued wife,\\r\\nWhom for this time we pardon. We enjoin thee,\\r\\nAs thou art liege-man to us, that thou carry\\r\\nThis female bastard hence and that thou bear it\\r\\nTo some remote and desert place quite out\\r\\nOf our dominions, and that there thou leave it,\\r\\nWithout more mercy, to its own protection\\r\\nAnd favour of the climate. As by strange fortune\\r\\nIt came to us, I do in justice charge thee,\\r\\nOn thy soul's peril and thy body's torture,\\r\\nThat thou commend it strangely to some place\\r\\nWhere chance may nurse or end it. Take it up.\\r\\nANTIGONUS\\r\\nI swear to do this, though a present death\\r\\nHad been more merciful. Come on, poor babe:\\r\\nSome powerful spirit instruct the kites and ravens\\r\\nTo be thy nurses! Wolves and bears, they say\\r\\nCasting their savageness aside have done\\r\\nLike offices of pity. Sir, be prosperous\\r\\nIn more than this deed does require! And blessing\\r\\nAgainst this cruelty fight on thy side,\\r\\nPoor thing, condemn'd to loss!\\r\\nExit with the child\\r\\n\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nNo, I'll not rear\\r\\nAnother's issue.\\r\\nEnter a Servant\\r\\n\\r\\nServant\\r\\nPlease your highness, posts\\r\\nFrom those you sent to the oracle are come\\r\\nAn hour since: Cleomenes and Dion,\\r\\nBeing well arrived from Delphos, are both landed,\\r\\nHasting to the court.\\r\\nFirst Lord\\r\\nSo please you, sir, their speed\\r\\nHath been beyond account.\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nTwenty-three days\\r\\nThey have been absent: 'tis good speed; foretells\\r\\nThe great Apollo suddenly will have\\r\\nThe truth of this appear. Prepare you, lords;\\r\\nSummon a session, that we may arraign\\r\\nOur most disloyal lady, for, as she hath\\r\\nBeen publicly accused, so shall she have\\r\\nA just and open trial. While she lives\\r\\nMy heart will be a burthen to me. Leave me,\\r\\nAnd think upon my bidding.\\r\\nExeunt\\r\\n\\r\\nACT III\\r\\nSCENE I. A sea-port in Sicilia.\\r\\nEnter CLEOMENES and DION\\r\\nCLEOMENES\\r\\nThe climate's delicate, the air most sweet,\\r\\nFertile the isle, the temple much surpassing\\r\\nThe common praise it bears.\\r\\nDION\\r\\nI shall report,\\r\\nFor most it caught me, the celestial habits,\\r\\nMethinks I so should term them, and the reverence\\r\\nOf the grave wearers. O, the sacrifice!\\r\\nHow ceremonious, solemn and unearthly\\r\\nIt was i' the offering!\\r\\nCLEOMENES\\r\\nBut of all, the burst\\r\\nAnd the ear-deafening voice o' the oracle,\\r\\nKin to Jove's thunder, so surprised my sense.\\r\\nThat I was nothing.\\r\\nDION\\r\\nIf the event o' the journey\\r\\nProve as successful to the queen,--O be't so!--\\r\\nAs it hath been to us rare, pleasant, speedy,\\r\\nThe time is worth the use on't.\\r\\nCLEOMENES\\r\\nGreat Apollo\\r\\nTurn all to the best! These proclamations,\\r\\nSo forcing faults upon Hermione,\\r\\nI little like.\\r\\nDION\\r\\nThe violent carriage of it\\r\\nWill clear or end the business: when the oracle,\\r\\nThus by Apollo's great divine seal'd up,\\r\\nShall the contents discover, something rare\\r\\nEven then will rush to knowledge. Go: fresh horses!\\r\\nAnd gracious be the issue!\\r\\nExeunt\\r\\n\\r\\nSCENE II. A court of Justice.\\r\\nEnter LEONTES, Lords, and Officers\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nThis sessions, to our great grief we pronounce,\\r\\nEven pushes 'gainst our heart: the party tried\\r\\nThe daughter of a king, our wife, and one\\r\\nOf us too much beloved. Let us be clear'd\\r\\nOf being tyrannous, since we so openly\\r\\nProceed in justice, which shall have due course,\\r\\nEven to the guilt or the purgation.\\r\\nProduce the prisoner.\\r\\nOfficer\\r\\nIt is his highness' pleasure that the queen\\r\\nAppear in person here in court. Silence!\\r\\nEnter HERMIONE guarded; PAULINA and Ladies attending\\r\\n\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nRead the indictment.\\r\\nOfficer\\r\\n[Reads] Hermione, queen to the worthy\\r\\nLeontes, king of Sicilia, thou art here accused and\\r\\narraigned of high treason, in committing adultery\\r\\nwith Polixenes, king of Bohemia, and conspiring\\r\\nwith Camillo to take away the life of our sovereign\\r\\nlord the king, thy royal husband: the pretence\\r\\nwhereof being by circumstances partly laid open,\\r\\nthou, Hermione, contrary to the faith and allegiance\\r\\nof a true subject, didst counsel and aid them, for\\r\\ntheir better safety, to fly away by night.\\r\\nHERMIONE\\r\\nSince what I am to say must be but that\\r\\nWhich contradicts my accusation and\\r\\nThe testimony on my part no other\\r\\nBut what comes from myself, it shall scarce boot me\\r\\nTo say 'not guilty:' mine integrity\\r\\nBeing counted falsehood, shall, as I express it,\\r\\nBe so received. But thus: if powers divine\\r\\nBehold our human actions, as they do,\\r\\nI doubt not then but innocence shall make\\r\\nFalse accusation blush and tyranny\\r\\nTremble at patience. You, my lord, best know,\\r\\nWho least will seem to do so, my past life\\r\\nHath been as continent, as chaste, as true,\\r\\nAs I am now unhappy; which is more\\r\\nThan history can pattern, though devised\\r\\nAnd play'd to take spectators. For behold me\\r\\nA fellow of the royal bed, which owe\\r\\nA moiety of the throne a great king's daughter,\\r\\nThe mother to a hopeful prince, here standing\\r\\nTo prate and talk for life and honour 'fore\\r\\nWho please to come and hear. For life, I prize it\\r\\nAs I weigh grief, which I would spare: for honour,\\r\\n'Tis a derivative from me to mine,\\r\\nAnd only that I stand for. I appeal\\r\\nTo your own conscience, sir, before Polixenes\\r\\nCame to your court, how I was in your grace,\\r\\nHow merited to be so; since he came,\\r\\nWith what encounter so uncurrent I\\r\\nHave strain'd to appear thus: if one jot beyond\\r\\nThe bound of honour, or in act or will\\r\\nThat way inclining, harden'd be the hearts\\r\\nOf all that hear me, and my near'st of kin\\r\\nCry fie upon my grave!\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nI ne'er heard yet\\r\\nThat any of these bolder vices wanted\\r\\nLess impudence to gainsay what they did\\r\\nThan to perform it first.\\r\\nHERMIONE\\r\\nThat's true enough;\\r\\nThrough 'tis a saying, sir, not due to me.\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nYou will not own it.\\r\\nHERMIONE\\r\\nMore than mistress of\\r\\nWhich comes to me in name of fault, I must not\\r\\nAt all acknowledge. For Polixenes,\\r\\nWith whom I am accused, I do confess\\r\\nI loved him as in honour he required,\\r\\nWith such a kind of love as might become\\r\\nA lady like me, with a love even such,\\r\\nSo and no other, as yourself commanded:\\r\\nWhich not to have done I think had been in me\\r\\nBoth disobedience and ingratitude\\r\\nTo you and toward your friend, whose love had spoke,\\r\\nEven since it could speak, from an infant, freely\\r\\nThat it was yours. Now, for conspiracy,\\r\\nI know not how it tastes; though it be dish'd\\r\\nFor me to try how: all I know of it\\r\\nIs that Camillo was an honest man;\\r\\nAnd why he left your court, the gods themselves,\\r\\nWotting no more than I, are ignorant.\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nYou knew of his departure, as you know\\r\\nWhat you have underta'en to do in's absence.\\r\\nHERMIONE\\r\\nSir,\\r\\nYou speak a language that I understand not:\\r\\nMy life stands in the level of your dreams,\\r\\nWhich I'll lay down.\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nYour actions are my dreams;\\r\\nYou had a bastard by Polixenes,\\r\\nAnd I but dream'd it. As you were past all shame,--\\r\\nThose of your fact are so--so past all truth:\\r\\nWhich to deny concerns more than avails; for as\\r\\nThy brat hath been cast out, like to itself,\\r\\nNo father owning it,--which is, indeed,\\r\\nMore criminal in thee than it,--so thou\\r\\nShalt feel our justice, in whose easiest passage\\r\\nLook for no less than death.\\r\\nHERMIONE\\r\\nSir, spare your threats:\\r\\nThe bug which you would fright me with I seek.\\r\\nTo me can life be no commodity:\\r\\nThe crown and comfort of my life, your favour,\\r\\nI do give lost; for I do feel it gone,\\r\\nBut know not how it went. My second joy\\r\\nAnd first-fruits of my body, from his presence\\r\\nI am barr'd, like one infectious. My third comfort\\r\\nStarr'd most unluckily, is from my breast,\\r\\nThe innocent milk in its most innocent mouth,\\r\\nHaled out to murder: myself on every post\\r\\nProclaimed a strumpet: with immodest hatred\\r\\nThe child-bed privilege denied, which 'longs\\r\\nTo women of all fashion; lastly, hurried\\r\\nHere to this place, i' the open air, before\\r\\nI have got strength of limit. Now, my liege,\\r\\nTell me what blessings I have here alive,\\r\\nThat I should fear to die? Therefore proceed.\\r\\nBut yet hear this: mistake me not; no life,\\r\\nI prize it not a straw, but for mine honour,\\r\\nWhich I would free, if I shall be condemn'd\\r\\nUpon surmises, all proofs sleeping else\\r\\nBut what your jealousies awake, I tell you\\r\\n'Tis rigor and not law.

Thy tyranny\\r\\nTogether working with thy jealousies,\\r\\nFancies too weak for boys, too green and idle\\r\\nFor girls of nine, O, think what they have done\\r\\nAnd then run mad indeed, stark mad! for all\\r\\nThy by-gone fooleries were but spices of it.\\r\\nThat thou betray'dst Polixenes,'twas nothing;\\r\\nThat did but show thee, of a fool, inconstant\\r\\nAnd damnable ingrateful: nor was't much,\\r\\nThou wouldst have poison'd good Camillo's honour,\\r\\nTo have him kill a king: poor trespasses,\\r\\nMore monstrous standing by: whereof I reckon\\r\\nThe casting forth to crows thy baby-daughter\\r\\nTo be or none or little; though a devil\\r\\nWould have shed water out of fire ere done't:\\r\\nNor is't directly laid to thee, the death\\r\\nOf the young prince, whose honourable thoughts,\\r\\nThoughts high for one so tender, cleft the heart\\r\\nThat could conceive a gross and foolish sire\\r\\nBlemish'd his gracious dam: this is not, no,\\r\\nLaid to thy answer: but the last,--O lords,\\r\\nWhen I have said, cry 'woe!' the queen, the queen,\\r\\nThe sweet'st, dear'st creature's dead,\\r\\nand vengeance for't\\r\\nNot dropp'd down yet.\\r\\nFirst Lord\\r\\nThe higher powers forbid!\\r\\nPAULINA\\r\\nI say she's dead; I'll swear't.

But, O thou tyrant!\\r\\nDo not repent these things, for they are heavier\\r\\nThan all thy woes can stir; therefore betake thee\\r\\nTo nothing but despair. A thousand knees\\r\\nTen thousand years together, naked, fasting,\\r\\nUpon a barren mountain and still winter\\r\\nIn storm perpetual, could not move the gods\\r\\nTo look that way thou wert.\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nGo on, go on\\r\\nThou canst not speak too much; I have deserved\\r\\nAll tongues to talk their bitterest.\\r\\nFirst Lord\\r\\nSay no more:\\r\\nHowe'er the business goes, you have made fault\\r\\nI' the boldness of your speech.\\r\\nPAULINA\\r\\nI am sorry for't:\\r\\nAll faults I make, when I shall come to know them,\\r\\nI do repent.

Prithee, bring me\\r\\nTo the dead bodies of my queen and son:\\r\\nOne grave shall be for both: upon them shall\\r\\nThe causes of their death appear, unto\\r\\nOur shame perpetual. Once a day I'll visit\\r\\nThe chapel where they lie, and tears shed there\\r\\nShall be my recreation: so long as nature\\r\\nWill bear up with this exercise, so long\\r\\nI daily vow to use it. Come and lead me\\r\\nUnto these sorrows.\\r\\nExeunt\\r\\n\\r\\nSCENE III. Bohemia. A desert country near the sea.\\r\\nEnter ANTIGONUS with a Child, and a Mariner\\r\\nANTIGONUS\\r\\nThou art perfect then, our ship hath touch'd upon\\r\\nThe deserts of Bohemia?\\r\\nMariner\\r\\nAy, my lord: and fear\\r\\nWe have landed in ill time: the skies look grimly\\r\\nAnd threaten present blusters. In my conscience,\\r\\nThe heavens with that we have in hand are angry\\r\\nAnd frown upon 's.\\r\\nANTIGONUS\\r\\nTheir sacred wills be done! Go, get aboard;\\r\\nLook to thy bark: I'll not be long before\\r\\nI call upon thee.\\r\\nMariner\\r\\nMake your best haste, and go not\\r\\nToo far i' the land: 'tis like to be loud weather;\\r\\nBesides, this place is famous for the creatures\\r\\nOf prey that keep upon't.\\r\\nANTIGONUS\\r\\nGo thou away:\\r\\nI'll follow instantly.\\r\\nMariner\\r\\nI am glad at heart\\r\\nTo be so rid o' the business.\\r\\nExit\\r\\n\\r\\nANTIGONUS\\r\\nCome, poor babe:\\r\\nI have heard, but not believed,\\r\\nthe spirits o' the dead\\r\\nMay walk again: if such thing be, thy mother\\r\\nAppear'd to me last night, for ne'er was dream\\r\\nSo like a waking. To me comes a creature,\\r\\nSometimes her head on one side, some another;\\r\\nI never saw a vessel of like sorrow,\\r\\nSo fill'd and so becoming: in pure white robes,\\r\\nLike very sanctity, she did approach\\r\\nMy cabin where I lay; thrice bow'd before me,\\r\\nAnd gasping to begin some speech, her eyes\\r\\nBecame two spouts: the fury spent, anon\\r\\nDid this break-from her: 'Good Antigonus,\\r\\nSince fate, against thy better disposition,\\r\\nHath made thy person for the thrower-out\\r\\nOf my poor babe, according to thine oath,\\r\\nPlaces remote enough are in Bohemia,\\r\\nThere weep and leave it crying; and, for the babe\\r\\nIs counted lost for ever, Perdita,\\r\\nI prithee, call't. For this ungentle business\\r\\nPut on thee by my lord, thou ne'er shalt see\\r\\nThy wife Paulina more.' And so, with shrieks\\r\\nShe melted into air. Affrighted much,\\r\\nI did in time collect myself and thought\\r\\nThis was so and no slumber. Dreams are toys:\\r\\nYet for this once, yea, superstitiously,\\r\\nI will be squared by this. I do believe\\r\\nHermione hath suffer'd death, and that\\r\\nApollo would, this being indeed the issue\\r\\nOf King Polixenes, it should here be laid,\\r\\nEither for life or death, upon the earth\\r\\nOf its right father. Blossom, speed thee well!\\r\\nThere lie, and there thy character: there these;\\r\\nWhich may, if fortune please, both breed thee, pretty,\\r\\nAnd still rest thine. The storm begins; poor wretch,\\r\\nThat for thy mother's fault art thus exposed\\r\\nTo loss and what may follow! Weep I cannot,\\r\\nBut my heart bleeds; and most accursed am I\\r\\nTo be by oath enjoin'd to this. Farewell!\\r\\nThe day frowns more and more: thou'rt like to have\\r\\nA lullaby too rough: I never saw\\r\\nThe heavens so dim by day. A savage clamour!\\r\\nWell may I get aboard! This is the chase:\\r\\nI am gone for ever.\\r\\nExit, pursued by a bear\\r\\n\\r\\nEnter a Shepherd\\r\\n\\r\\nShepherd\\r\\nI would there were no age between sixteen and\\r\\nthree-and-twenty, or that youth would sleep out the\\r\\nrest; for there is nothing in the between but\\r\\ngetting wenches with child, wronging the ancientry,\\r\\nstealing, fighting--Hark you now! Would any but\\r\\nthese boiled brains of nineteen and two-and-twenty\\r\\nhunt this weather? They have scared away two of my\\r\\nbest sheep, which I fear the wolf will sooner find\\r\\nthan the master: if any where I have them, 'tis by\\r\\nthe seaside, browsing of ivy. Good luck, an't be thy\\r\\nwill what have we here! Mercy on 's, a barne a very\\r\\npretty barne! A boy or a child, I wonder? A\\r\\npretty one; a very pretty one: sure, some 'scape:\\r\\nthough I am not bookish, yet I can read\\r\\nwaiting-gentlewoman in the 'scape. This has been\\r\\nsome stair-work, some trunk-work, some\\r\\nbehind-door-work: they were warmer that got this\\r\\nthan the poor thing is here. I'll take it up for\\r\\npity: yet I'll tarry till my son come; he hallooed\\r\\nbut even now. Whoa, ho, hoa!\\r\\nEnter Clown\\r\\n\\r\\nClown\\r\\nHilloa, loa!\\r\\nShepherd\\r\\nWhat, art so near? If thou'lt see a thing to talk\\r\\non when thou art dead and rotten, come hither. What\\r\\nailest thou, man?\\r\\nClown\\r\\nI have seen two such sights, by sea and by land!\\r\\nbut I am not to say it is a sea, for it is now the\\r\\nsky: betwixt the firmament and it you cannot thrust\\r\\na bodkin's point.\\r\\nShepherd\\r\\nWhy, boy, how is it?\\r\\nClown\\r\\nI would you did but see how it chafes, how it rages,\\r\\nhow it takes up the shore! but that's not the\\r\\npoint. O, the most piteous cry of the poor souls!\\r\\nsometimes to see 'em, and not to see 'em; now the\\r\\nship boring the moon with her main-mast, and anon\\r\\nswallowed with yest and froth, as you'ld thrust a\\r\\ncork into a hogshead. And then for the\\r\\nland-service, to see how the bear tore out his\\r\\nshoulder-bone; how he cried to me for help and said\\r\\nhis name was Antigonus, a nobleman. But to make an\\r\\nend of the ship, to see how the sea flap-dragoned\\r\\nit: but, first, how the poor souls roared, and the\\r\\nsea mocked them; and how the poor gentleman roared\\r\\nand the bear mocked him, both roaring louder than\\r\\nthe sea or weather.\\r\\nShepherd\\r\\nName of mercy, when was this, boy?\\r\\nClown\\r\\nNow, now: I have not winked since I saw these\\r\\nsights: the men are not yet cold under water, nor\\r\\nthe bear half dined on the gentleman: he's at it\\r\\nnow.\\r\\nShepherd\\r\\nWould I had been by, to have helped the old man!\\r\\nClown\\r\\nI would you had been by the ship side, to have\\r\\nhelped her: there your charity would have lacked footing.\\r\\nShepherd\\r\\nHeavy matters! heavy matters! but look thee here,\\r\\nboy. Now bless thyself: thou mettest with things\\r\\ndying, I with things newborn. Here's a sight for\\r\\nthee; look thee, a bearing-cloth for a squire's\\r\\nchild! look thee here; take up, take up, boy;\\r\\nopen't. So, let's see: it was told me I should be\\r\\nrich by the fairies. This is some changeling:\\r\\nopen't. What's within, boy?\\r\\nClown\\r\\nYou're a made old man: if the sins of your youth\\r\\nare forgiven you, you're well to live. Gold! all gold!\\r\\nShepherd\\r\\nThis is fairy gold, boy, and 'twill prove so: up\\r\\nwith't, keep it close: home, home, the next way.\\r\\nWe are lucky, boy; and to be so still requires\\r\\nnothing but secrecy. Let my sheep go: come, good\\r\\nboy, the next way home.\\r\\nClown\\r\\nGo you the next way with your findings. I'll go see\\r\\nif the bear be gone from the gentleman and how much\\r\\nhe hath eaten: they are never curst but when they\\r\\nare hungry: if there be any of him left, I'll bury\\r\\nit.\\r\\nShepherd\\r\\nThat's a good deed. If thou mayest discern by that\\r\\nwhich is left of him what he is, fetch me to the\\r\\nsight of him.\\r\\nClown\\r\\nMarry, will I; and you shall help to put him i' the ground.\\r\\nShepherd\\r\\n'Tis a lucky day, boy, and we'll do good deeds on't.\\r\\nExeunt\\r\\n\\r\\nACT IV\\r\\nSCENE I:\\r\\nEnter Time, the Chorus\\r\\n\\r\\nTime\\r\\nI, that please some, try all, both joy and terror\\r\\nOf good and bad, that makes and unfolds error,\\r\\nNow take upon me, in the name of Time,\\r\\nTo use my wings. Impute it not a crime\\r\\nTo me or my swift passage, that I slide\\r\\nO'er sixteen years and leave the growth untried\\r\\nOf that wide gap, since it is in my power\\r\\nTo o'erthrow law and in one self-born hour\\r\\nTo plant and o'erwhelm custom. Let me pass\\r\\nThe same I am, ere ancient'st order was\\r\\nOr what is now received: I witness to\\r\\nThe times that brought them in; so shall I do\\r\\nTo the freshest things now reigning and make stale\\r\\nThe glistering of this present, as my tale\\r\\nNow seems to it. Your patience this allowing,\\r\\nI turn my glass and give my scene such growing\\r\\nAs you had slept between: Leontes leaving,\\r\\nThe effects of his fond jealousies so grieving\\r\\nThat he shuts up himself, imagine me,\\r\\nGentle spectators, that I now may be\\r\\nIn fair Bohemia, and remember well,\\r\\nI mentioned a son o' the king's, which Florizel\\r\\nI now name to you; and with speed so pace\\r\\nTo speak of Perdita, now grown in grace\\r\\nEqual with wondering: what of her ensues\\r\\nI list not prophecy; but let Time's news\\r\\nBe known when 'tis brought forth.\\r\\nA shepherd's daughter,\\r\\nAnd what to her adheres, which follows after,\\r\\nIs the argument of Time. Of this allow,\\r\\nIf ever you have spent time worse ere now;\\r\\nIf never, yet that Time himself doth say\\r\\nHe wishes earnestly you never may.\\r\\nExit\\r\\n\\r\\nSCENE II. Bohemia. The palace of POLIXENES.\\r\\nEnter POLIXENES and CAMILLO\\r\\nPOLIXENES\\r\\nI pray thee, good Camillo, be no more importunate:\\r\\n'tis a sickness denying thee any thing; a death to\\r\\ngrant this.\\r\\nCAMILLO\\r\\nIt is fifteen years since I saw my country: though\\r\\nI have for the most part been aired abroad, I\\r\\ndesire to lay my bones there. Besides, the penitent\\r\\nking, my master, hath sent for me; to whose feeling\\r\\nsorrows I might be some allay, or I o'erween to\\r\\nthink so, which is another spur to my departure.\\r\\nPOLIXENES\\r\\nAs thou lovest me, Camillo, wipe not out the rest of\\r\\nthy services by leaving me now: the need I have of\\r\\nthee thine own goodness hath made; better not to\\r\\nhave had thee than thus to want thee: thou, having\\r\\nmade me businesses which none without thee can\\r\\nsufficiently manage, must either stay to execute\\r\\nthem thyself or take away with thee the very\\r\\nservices thou hast done; which if I have not enough\\r\\nconsidered, as too much I cannot, to be more\\r\\nthankful to thee shall be my study, and my profit\\r\\ntherein the heaping friendships. Of that fatal\\r\\ncountry, Sicilia, prithee speak no more; whose very\\r\\nnaming punishes me with the remembrance of that\\r\\npenitent, as thou callest him, and reconciled king,\\r\\nmy brother; whose loss of his most precious queen\\r\\nand children are even now to be afresh lamented.\\r\\nSay to me, when sawest thou the Prince Florizel, my\\r\\nson? Kings are no less unhappy, their issue not\\r\\nbeing gracious, than they are in losing them when\\r\\nthey have approved their virtues.\\r\\nCAMILLO\\r\\nSir, it is three days since I saw the prince. What\\r\\nhis happier affairs may be, are to me unknown: but I\\r\\nhave missingly noted, he is of late much retired\\r\\nfrom court and is less frequent to his princely\\r\\nexercises than formerly he hath appeared.\\r\\nPOLIXENES\\r\\nI have considered so much, Camillo, and with some\\r\\ncare; so far that I have eyes under my service which\\r\\nlook upon his removedness; from whom I have this\\r\\nintelligence, that he is seldom from the house of a\\r\\nmost homely shepherd; a man, they say, that from\\r\\nvery nothing, and beyond the imagination of his\\r\\nneighbours, is grown into an unspeakable estate.\\r\\nCAMILLO\\r\\nI have heard, sir, of such a man, who hath a\\r\\ndaughter of most rare note: the report of her is\\r\\nextended more than can be thought to begin from such a cottage.\\r\\nPOLIXENES\\r\\nThat's likewise part of my intelligence; but, I\\r\\nfear, the angle that plucks our son thither. Thou\\r\\nshalt accompany us to the place; where we will, not\\r\\nappearing what we are, have some question with the\\r\\nshepherd; from whose simplicity I think it not\\r\\nuneasy to get the cause of my son's resort thither.\\r\\nPrithee, be my present partner in this business, and\\r\\nlay aside the thoughts of Sicilia.\\r\\nCAMILLO\\r\\nI willingly obey your command.\\r\\nPOLIXENES\\r\\nMy best Camillo!

This your sheep-shearing\\r\\nIs as a meeting of the petty gods,\\r\\nAnd you the queen on't.\\r\\nPERDITA\\r\\nSir, my gracious lord,\\r\\nTo chide at your extremes it not becomes me:\\r\\nO, pardon, that I name them! Your high self,\\r\\nThe gracious mark o' the land, you have obscured\\r\\nWith a swain's wearing, and me, poor lowly maid,\\r\\nMost goddess-like prank'd up: but that our feasts\\r\\nIn every mess have folly and the feeders\\r\\nDigest it with a custom, I should blush\\r\\nTo see you so attired, sworn, I think,\\r\\nTo show myself a glass.\\r\\nFLORIZEL\\r\\nI bless the time\\r\\nWhen my good falcon made her flight across\\r\\nThy father's ground.\\r\\nPERDITA\\r\\nNow Jove afford you cause!\\r\\nTo me the difference forges dread; your greatness\\r\\nHath not been used to fear. Even now I tremble\\r\\nTo think your father, by some accident,\\r\\nShould pass this way as you did: O, the Fates!\\r\\nHow would he look, to see his work so noble\\r\\nVilely bound up? What would he say? Or how\\r\\nShould I, in these my borrow'd flaunts, behold\\r\\nThe sternness of his presence?\\r\\nFLORIZEL\\r\\nApprehend\\r\\nNothing but jollity. The gods themselves,\\r\\nHumbling their deities to love, have taken\\r\\nThe shapes of beasts upon them: Jupiter\\r\\nBecame a bull, and bellow'd; the green Neptune\\r\\nA ram, and bleated; and the fire-robed god,\\r\\nGolden Apollo, a poor humble swain,\\r\\nAs I seem now. Their transformations\\r\\nWere never for a piece of beauty rarer,\\r\\nNor in a way so chaste, since my desires\\r\\nRun not before mine honour, nor my lusts\\r\\nBurn hotter than my faith.\\r\\nPERDITA\\r\\nO, but, sir,\\r\\nYour resolution cannot hold, when 'tis\\r\\nOpposed, as it must be, by the power of the king:\\r\\nOne of these two must be necessities,\\r\\nWhich then will speak, that you must\\r\\nchange this purpose,\\r\\nOr I my life.\\r\\nFLORIZEL\\r\\nThou dearest Perdita,\\r\\nWith these forced thoughts, I prithee, darken not\\r\\nThe mirth o' the feast. Or I'll be thine, my fair,\\r\\nOr not my father's. For I cannot be\\r\\nMine own, nor any thing to any, if\\r\\nI be not thine. To this I am most constant,\\r\\nThough destiny say no. Be merry, gentle;\\r\\nStrangle such thoughts as these with any thing\\r\\nThat you behold the while. Your guests are coming:\\r\\nLift up your countenance, as it were the day\\r\\nOf celebration of that nuptial which\\r\\nWe two have sworn shall come.\\r\\nPERDITA\\r\\nO lady Fortune,\\r\\nStand you auspicious!\\r\\nFLORIZEL\\r\\nSee, your guests approach:\\r\\nAddress yourself to entertain them sprightly,\\r\\nAnd let's be red with mirth.\\r\\nEnter Shepherd, Clown, MOPSA, DORCAS, and others, with POLIXENES and CAMILLO disguised\\r\\n\\r\\nShepherd\\r\\nFie, daughter! when my old wife lived, upon\\r\\nThis day she was both pantler, butler, cook,\\r\\nBoth dame and servant; welcomed all, served all;\\r\\nWould sing her song and dance her turn; now here,\\r\\nAt upper end o' the table, now i' the middle;\\r\\nOn his shoulder, and his; her face o' fire\\r\\nWith labour and the thing she took to quench it,\\r\\nShe would to each one sip. You are retired,\\r\\nAs if you were a feasted one and not\\r\\nThe hostess of the meeting: pray you, bid\\r\\nThese unknown friends to's welcome; for it is\\r\\nA way to make us better friends, more known.\\r\\nCome, quench your blushes and present yourself\\r\\nThat which you are, mistress o' the feast: come on,\\r\\nAnd bid us welcome to your sheep-shearing,\\r\\nAs your good flock shall prosper.\\r\\nPERDITA\\r\\n[To POLIXENES] Sir, welcome:\\r\\nIt is my father's will I should take on me\\r\\nThe hostess-ship o' the day.\\r\\nTo CAMILLO\\r\\n\\r\\nYou're welcome, sir.\\r\\nGive me those flowers there, Dorcas. Reverend sirs,\\r\\nFor you there's rosemary and rue; these keep\\r\\nSeeming and savour all the winter long:\\r\\nGrace and remembrance be to you both,\\r\\nAnd welcome to our shearing!\\r\\nPOLIXENES\\r\\nShepherdess,\\r\\nA fair one are you--well you fit our ages\\r\\nWith flowers of winter.\\r\\nPERDITA\\r\\nSir, the year growing ancient,\\r\\nNot yet on summer's death, nor on the birth\\r\\nOf trembling winter, the fairest\\r\\nflowers o' the season\\r\\nAre our carnations and streak'd gillyvors,\\r\\nWhich some call nature's bastards: of that kind\\r\\nOur rustic garden's barren; and I care not\\r\\nTo get slips of them.\\r\\nPOLIXENES\\r\\nWherefore, gentle maiden,\\r\\nDo you neglect them?\\r\\nPERDITA\\r\\nFor I have heard it said\\r\\nThere is an art which in their piedness shares\\r\\nWith great creating nature.\\r\\nPOLIXENES\\r\\nSay there be;\\r\\nYet nature is made better by no mean\\r\\nBut nature makes that mean: so, over that art\\r\\nWhich you say adds to nature, is an art\\r\\nThat nature makes. You see, sweet maid, we marry\\r\\nA gentler scion to the wildest stock,\\r\\nAnd make conceive a bark of baser kind\\r\\nBy bud of nobler race: this is an art\\r\\nWhich does mend nature, change it rather, but\\r\\nThe art itself is nature.\\r\\nPERDITA\\r\\nSo it is.\\r\\nPOLIXENES\\r\\nThen make your garden rich in gillyvors,\\r\\nAnd do not call them bastards.\\r\\nPERDITA\\r\\nI'll not put\\r\\nThe dibble in earth to set one slip of them;\\r\\nNo more than were I painted I would wish\\r\\nThis youth should say 'twere well and only therefore\\r\\nDesire to breed by me. Here's flowers for you;\\r\\nHot lavender, mints, savoury, marjoram;\\r\\nThe marigold, that goes to bed wi' the sun\\r\\nAnd with him rises weeping: these are flowers\\r\\nOf middle summer, and I think they are given\\r\\nTo men of middle age. You're very welcome.\\r\\nCAMILLO\\r\\nI should leave grazing, were I of your flock,\\r\\nAnd only live by gazing.\\r\\nPERDITA\\r\\nOut, alas!\\r\\nYou'd be so lean, that blasts of January\\r\\nWould blow you through and through.\\r\\nNow, my fair'st friend,\\r\\nI would I had some flowers o' the spring that might\\r\\nBecome your time of day; and yours, and yours,\\r\\nThat wear upon your virgin branches yet\\r\\nYour maidenheads growing: O Proserpina,\\r\\nFor the flowers now, that frighted thou let'st fall\\r\\nFrom Dis's waggon! daffodils,\\r\\nThat come before the swallow dares, and take\\r\\nThe winds of March with beauty; violets dim,\\r\\nBut sweeter than the lids of Juno's eyes\\r\\nOr Cytherea's breath; pale primroses\\r\\nThat die unmarried, ere they can behold\\r\\nBight Phoebus in his strength--a malady\\r\\nMost incident to maids; bold oxlips and\\r\\nThe crown imperial; lilies of all kinds,\\r\\nThe flower-de-luce being one! O, these I lack,\\r\\nTo make you garlands of, and my sweet friend,\\r\\nTo strew him o'er and o'er!\\r\\nFLORIZEL\\r\\nWhat, like a corse?\\r\\nPERDITA\\r\\nNo, like a bank for love to lie and play on;\\r\\nNot like a corse; or if, not to be buried,\\r\\nBut quick and in mine arms. Come, take your flowers:\\r\\nMethinks I play as I have seen them do\\r\\nIn Whitsun pastorals: sure this robe of mine\\r\\nDoes change my disposition.\\r\\nFLORIZEL\\r\\nWhat you do\\r\\nStill betters what is done. When you speak, sweet.\\r\\nI'ld have you do it ever: when you sing,\\r\\nI'ld have you buy and sell so, so give alms,\\r\\nPray so; and, for the ordering your affairs,\\r\\nTo sing them too: when you do dance, I wish you\\r\\nA wave o' the sea, that you might ever do\\r\\nNothing but that; move still, still so,\\r\\nAnd own no other function: each your doing,\\r\\nSo singular in each particular,\\r\\nCrowns what you are doing in the present deed,\\r\\nThat all your acts are queens.\\r\\nPERDITA\\r\\nO Doricles,\\r\\nYour praises are too large: but that your youth,\\r\\nAnd the true blood which peepeth fairly through't,\\r\\nDo plainly give you out an unstain'd shepherd,\\r\\nWith wisdom I might fear, my Doricles,\\r\\nYou woo'd me the false way.\\r\\nFLORIZEL\\r\\nI think you have\\r\\nAs little skill to fear as I have purpose\\r\\nTo put you to't. But come; our dance, I pray:\\r\\nYour hand, my Perdita: so turtles pair,\\r\\nThat never mean to part.\\r\\nPERDITA\\r\\nI'll swear for 'em.\\r\\nPOLIXENES\\r\\nThis is the prettiest low-born lass that ever\\r\\nRan on the green-sward: nothing she does or seems\\r\\nBut smacks of something greater than herself,\\r\\nToo noble for this place.\\r\\nCAMILLO\\r\\nHe tells her something\\r\\nThat makes her blood look out: good sooth, she is\\r\\nThe queen of curds and cream.\\r\\nClown\\r\\nCome on, strike up!\\r\\nDORCAS\\r\\nMopsa must be your mistress: marry, garlic,\\r\\nTo mend her kissing with!\\r\\nMOPSA\\r\\nNow, in good time!\\r\\nClown\\r\\nNot a word, a word; we stand upon our manners.\\r\\nCome, strike up!\\r\\nMusic. Here a dance of Shepherds and Shepherdesses\\r\\n\\r\\nPOLIXENES\\r\\nPray, good shepherd, what fair swain is this\\r\\nWhich dances with your daughter?\\r\\nShepherd\\r\\nThey call him Doricles; and boasts himself\\r\\nTo have a worthy feeding: but I have it\\r\\nUpon his own report and I believe it;\\r\\nHe looks like sooth. He says he loves my daughter:\\r\\nI think so too; for never gazed the moon\\r\\nUpon the water as he'll stand and read\\r\\nAs 'twere my daughter's eyes: and, to be plain.\\r\\nI think there is not half a kiss to choose\\r\\nWho loves another best.\\r\\nPOLIXENES\\r\\nShe dances featly.\\r\\nShepherd\\r\\nSo she does any thing; though I report it,\\r\\nThat should be silent: if young Doricles\\r\\nDo light upon her, she shall bring him that\\r\\nWhich he not dreams of.\\r\\nEnter Servant\\r\\n\\r\\nServant\\r\\nO master, if you did but hear the pedlar at the\\r\\ndoor, you would never dance again after a tabour and\\r\\npipe; no, the bagpipe could not move you: he sings\\r\\nseveral tunes faster than you'll tell money; he\\r\\nutters them as he had eaten ballads and all men's\\r\\nears grew to his tunes.\\r\\nClown\\r\\nHe could never come better; he shall come in. I\\r\\nlove a ballad but even too well, if it be doleful\\r\\nmatter merrily set down, or a very pleasant thing\\r\\nindeed and sung lamentably.\\r\\nServant\\r\\nHe hath songs for man or woman, of all sizes; no\\r\\nmilliner can so fit his customers with gloves: he\\r\\nhas the prettiest love-songs for maids; so without\\r\\nbawdry, which is strange; with such delicate\\r\\nburthens of dildos and fadings, 'jump her and thump\\r\\nher;' and where some stretch-mouthed rascal would,\\r\\nas it were, mean mischief and break a foul gap into\\r\\nthe matter, he makes the maid to answer 'Whoop, do me\\r\\nno harm, good man;' puts him off, slights him, with\\r\\n'Whoop, do me no harm, good man.'\\r\\nPOLIXENES\\r\\nThis is a brave fellow.\\r\\nClown\\r\\nBelieve me, thou talkest of an admirable conceited\\r\\nfellow. Has he any unbraided wares?\\r\\nServant\\r\\nHe hath ribbons of an the colours i' the rainbow;\\r\\npoints more than all the lawyers in Bohemia can\\r\\nlearnedly handle, though they come to him by the\\r\\ngross: inkles, caddisses, cambrics, lawns: why, he\\r\\nsings 'em over as they were gods or goddesses; you\\r\\nwould think a smock were a she-angel, he so chants\\r\\nto the sleeve-hand and the work about the square on't.\\r\\nClown\\r\\nPrithee bring him in; and let him approach singing.\\r\\nPERDITA\\r\\nForewarn him that he use no scurrilous words in 's tunes.\\r\\nExit Servant\\r\\n\\r\\nClown\\r\\nYou have of these pedlars, that have more in them\\r\\nthan you'ld think, sister.\\r\\nPERDITA\\r\\nAy, good brother, or go about to think.\\r\\nEnter AUTOLYCUS, singing\\r\\n\\r\\nAUTOLYCUS\\r\\nLawn as white as driven snow;\\r\\nCyprus black as e'er was crow;\\r\\nGloves as sweet as damask roses;\\r\\nMasks for faces and for noses;\\r\\nBugle bracelet, necklace amber,\\r\\nPerfume for a lady's chamber;\\r\\nGolden quoifs and stomachers,\\r\\nFor my lads to give their dears:\\r\\nPins and poking-sticks of steel,\\r\\nWhat maids lack from head to heel:\\r\\nCome buy of me, come; come buy, come buy;\\r\\nBuy lads, or else your lasses cry: Come buy.\\r\\nClown\\r\\nIf I were not in love with Mopsa, thou shouldst take\\r\\nno money of me; but being enthralled as I am, it\\r\\nwill also be the bondage of certain ribbons and gloves.\\r\\nMOPSA\\r\\nI was promised them against the feast; but they come\\r\\nnot too late now.\\r\\nDORCAS\\r\\nHe hath promised you more than that, or there be liars.\\r\\nMOPSA\\r\\nHe hath paid you all he promised you; may be, he has\\r\\npaid you more, which will shame you to give him again.\\r\\nClown\\r\\nIs there no manners left among maids? will they\\r\\nwear their plackets where they should bear their\\r\\nfaces? Is there not milking-time, when you are\\r\\ngoing to bed, or kiln-hole, to whistle off these\\r\\nsecrets, but you must be tittle-tattling before all\\r\\nour guests? 'tis well they are whispering: clamour\\r\\nyour tongues, and not a word more.\\r\\nMOPSA\\r\\nI have done. Come, you promised me a tawdry-lace\\r\\nand a pair of sweet gloves.\\r\\nClown\\r\\nHave I not told thee how I was cozened by the way\\r\\nand lost all my money?\\r\\nAUTOLYCUS\\r\\nAnd indeed, sir, there are cozeners abroad;\\r\\ntherefore it behoves men to be wary.\\r\\nClown\\r\\nFear not thou, man, thou shalt lose nothing here.\\r\\nAUTOLYCUS\\r\\nI hope so, sir; for I have about me many parcels of charge.\\r\\nClown\\r\\nWhat hast here? ballads?\\r\\nMOPSA\\r\\nPray now, buy some: I love a ballad in print o'\\r\\nlife, for then we are sure they are true.\\r\\nAUTOLYCUS\\r\\nHere's one to a very doleful tune, how a usurer's\\r\\nwife was brought to bed of twenty money-bags at a\\r\\nburthen and how she longed to eat adders' heads and\\r\\ntoads carbonadoed.\\r\\nMOPSA\\r\\nIs it true, think you?\\r\\nAUTOLYCUS\\r\\nVery true, and but a month old.\\r\\nDORCAS\\r\\nBless me from marrying a usurer!\\r\\nAUTOLYCUS\\r\\nHere's the midwife's name to't, one Mistress\\r\\nTale-porter, and five or six honest wives that were\\r\\npresent. Why should I carry lies abroad?\\r\\nMOPSA\\r\\nPray you now, buy it.\\r\\nClown\\r\\nCome on, lay it by: and let's first see moe\\r\\nballads; we'll buy the other things anon.\\r\\nAUTOLYCUS\\r\\nHere's another ballad of a fish, that appeared upon\\r\\nthe coast on Wednesday the four-score of April,\\r\\nforty thousand fathom above water, and sung this\\r\\nballad against the hard hearts of maids: it was\\r\\nthought she was a woman and was turned into a cold\\r\\nfish for she would not exchange flesh with one that\\r\\nloved her: the ballad is very pitiful and as true.\\r\\nDORCAS\\r\\nIs it true too, think you?\\r\\nAUTOLYCUS\\r\\nFive justices' hands at it, and witnesses more than\\r\\nmy pack will hold.\\r\\nClown\\r\\nLay it by too: another.\\r\\nAUTOLYCUS\\r\\nThis is a merry ballad, but a very pretty one.\\r\\nMOPSA\\r\\nLet's have some merry ones.\\r\\nAUTOLYCUS\\r\\nWhy, this is a passing merry one and goes to\\r\\nthe tune of 'Two maids wooing a man:' there's\\r\\nscarce a maid westward but she sings it; 'tis in\\r\\nrequest, I can tell you.\\r\\nMOPSA\\r\\nWe can both sing it: if thou'lt bear a part, thou\\r\\nshalt hear; 'tis in three parts.\\r\\nDORCAS\\r\\nWe had the tune on't a month ago.\\r\\nAUTOLYCUS\\r\\nI can bear my part; you must know 'tis my\\r\\noccupation; have at it with you.\\r\\nSONG\\r\\n\\r\\nAUTOLYCUS\\r\\nGet you hence, for I must go\\r\\nWhere it fits not you to know.\\r\\nDORCAS\\r\\nWhither?\\r\\nMOPSA\\r\\nO, whither?\\r\\nDORCAS\\r\\nWhither?\\r\\nMOPSA\\r\\nIt becomes thy oath full well,\\r\\nThou to me thy secrets tell.\\r\\nDORCAS\\r\\nMe too, let me go thither.\\r\\nMOPSA\\r\\nOr thou goest to the orange or mill.\\r\\nDORCAS\\r\\nIf to either, thou dost ill.\\r\\nAUTOLYCUS\\r\\nNeither.\\r\\nDORCAS\\r\\nWhat, neither?\\r\\nAUTOLYCUS\\r\\nNeither.\\r\\nDORCAS\\r\\nThou hast sworn my love to be.\\r\\nMOPSA\\r\\nThou hast sworn it more to me:\\r\\nThen whither goest? say, whither?\\r\\nClown\\r\\nWe'll have this song out anon by ourselves: my\\r\\nfather and the gentlemen are in sad talk, and we'll\\r\\nnot trouble them. Come, bring away thy pack after\\r\\nme. Wenches, I'll buy for you both. Pedlar, let's\\r\\nhave the first choice. Follow me, girls.\\r\\nExit with DORCAS and MOPSA\\r\\n\\r\\nAUTOLYCUS\\r\\nAnd you shall pay well for 'em.\\r\\nFollows singing\\r\\n\\r\\nWill you buy any tape,\\r\\nOr lace for your cape,\\r\\nMy dainty duck, my dear-a?\\r\\nAny silk, any thread,\\r\\nAny toys for your head,\\r\\nOf the new'st and finest, finest wear-a?\\r\\nCome to the pedlar;\\r\\nMoney's a medler.\\r\\nThat doth utter all men's ware-a.\\r\\nExit\\r\\n\\r\\nRe-enter Servant\\r\\n\\r\\nServant\\r\\nMaster, there is three carters, three shepherds,\\r\\nthree neat-herds, three swine-herds, that have made\\r\\nthemselves all men of hair, they call themselves\\r\\nSaltiers, and they have a dance which the wenches\\r\\nsay is a gallimaufry of gambols, because they are\\r\\nnot in't; but they themselves are o' the mind, if it\\r\\nbe not too rough for some that know little but\\r\\nbowling, it will please plentifully.\\r\\nShepherd\\r\\nAway! we'll none on 't: here has been too much\\r\\nhomely foolery already. I know, sir, we weary you.\\r\\nPOLIXENES\\r\\nYou weary those that refresh us: pray, let's see\\r\\nthese four threes of herdsmen.\\r\\nServant\\r\\nOne three of them, by their own report, sir, hath\\r\\ndanced before the king; and not the worst of the\\r\\nthree but jumps twelve foot and a half by the squier.\\r\\nShepherd\\r\\nLeave your prating: since these good men are\\r\\npleased, let them come in; but quickly now.\\r\\nServant\\r\\nWhy, they stay at door, sir.\\r\\nExit\\r\\n\\r\\nHere a dance of twelve Satyrs\\r\\n\\r\\nPOLIXENES\\r\\nO, father, you'll know more of that hereafter.\\r\\nTo CAMILLO\\r\\n\\r\\nIs it not too far gone? 'Tis time to part them.\\r\\nHe's simple and tells much.\\r\\nTo FLORIZEL\\r\\n\\r\\nHow now, fair shepherd!\\r\\nYour heart is full of something that does take\\r\\nYour mind from feasting. Sooth, when I was young\\r\\nAnd handed love as you do, I was wont\\r\\nTo load my she with knacks: I would have ransack'd\\r\\nThe pedlar's silken treasury and have pour'd it\\r\\nTo her acceptance; you have let him go\\r\\nAnd nothing marted with him. If your lass\\r\\nInterpretation should abuse and call this\\r\\nYour lack of love or bounty, you were straited\\r\\nFor a reply, at least if you make a care\\r\\nOf happy holding her.\\r\\nFLORIZEL\\r\\nOld sir, I know\\r\\nShe prizes not such trifles as these are:\\r\\nThe gifts she looks from me are pack'd and lock'd\\r\\nUp in my heart; which I have given already,\\r\\nBut not deliver'd. O, hear me breathe my life\\r\\nBefore this ancient sir, who, it should seem,\\r\\nHath sometime loved! I take thy hand, this hand,\\r\\nAs soft as dove's down and as white as it,\\r\\nOr Ethiopian's tooth, or the fann'd\\r\\nsnow that's bolted\\r\\nBy the northern blasts twice o'er.\\r\\nPOLIXENES\\r\\nWhat follows this?\\r\\nHow prettily the young swain seems to wash\\r\\nThe hand was fair before! I have put you out:\\r\\nBut to your protestation; let me hear\\r\\nWhat you profess.\\r\\nFLORIZEL\\r\\nDo, and be witness to 't.\\r\\nPOLIXENES\\r\\nAnd this my neighbour too?\\r\\nFLORIZEL\\r\\nAnd he, and more\\r\\nThan he, and men, the earth, the heavens, and all:\\r\\nThat, were I crown'd the most imperial monarch,\\r\\nThereof most worthy, were I the fairest youth\\r\\nThat ever made eye swerve, had force and knowledge\\r\\nMore than was ever man's, I would not prize them\\r\\nWithout her love; for her employ them all;\\r\\nCommend them and condemn them to her service\\r\\nOr to their own perdition.\\r\\nPOLIXENES\\r\\nFairly offer'd.\\r\\nCAMILLO\\r\\nThis shows a sound affection.\\r\\nShepherd\\r\\nBut, my daughter,\\r\\nSay you the like to him?\\r\\nPERDITA\\r\\nI cannot speak\\r\\nSo well, nothing so well; no, nor mean better:\\r\\nBy the pattern of mine own thoughts I cut out\\r\\nThe purity of his.\\r\\nShepherd\\r\\nTake hands, a bargain!\\r\\nAnd, friends unknown, you shall bear witness to 't:\\r\\nI give my daughter to him, and will make\\r\\nHer portion equal his.\\r\\nFLORIZEL\\r\\nO, that must be\\r\\nI' the virtue of your daughter: one being dead,\\r\\nI shall have more than you can dream of yet;\\r\\nEnough then for your wonder. But, come on,\\r\\nContract us 'fore these witnesses.\\r\\nShepherd\\r\\nCome, your hand;\\r\\nAnd, daughter, yours.\\r\\nPOLIXENES\\r\\nSoft, swain, awhile, beseech you;\\r\\nHave you a father?\\r\\nFLORIZEL\\r\\nI have: but what of him?\\r\\nPOLIXENES\\r\\nKnows he of this?\\r\\nFLORIZEL\\r\\nHe neither does nor shall.\\r\\nPOLIXENES\\r\\nMethinks a father\\r\\nIs at the nuptial of his son a guest\\r\\nThat best becomes the table. Pray you once more,\\r\\nIs not your father grown incapable\\r\\nOf reasonable affairs? is he not stupid\\r\\nWith age and altering rheums? can he speak? hear?\\r\\nKnow man from man? dispute his own estate?\\r\\nLies he not bed-rid? and again does nothing\\r\\nBut what he did being childish?\\r\\nFLORIZEL\\r\\nNo, good sir;\\r\\nHe has his health and ampler strength indeed\\r\\nThan most have of his age.\\r\\nPOLIXENES\\r\\nBy my white beard,\\r\\nYou offer him, if this be so, a wrong\\r\\nSomething unfilial: reason my son\\r\\nShould choose himself a wife, but as good reason\\r\\nThe father, all whose joy is nothing else\\r\\nBut fair posterity, should hold some counsel\\r\\nIn such a business.\\r\\nFLORIZEL\\r\\nI yield all this;\\r\\nBut for some other reasons, my grave sir,\\r\\nWhich 'tis not fit you know, I not acquaint\\r\\nMy father of this business.\\r\\nPOLIXENES\\r\\nLet him know't.\\r\\nFLORIZEL\\r\\nHe shall not.\\r\\nPOLIXENES\\r\\nPrithee, let him.\\r\\nFLORIZEL\\r\\nNo, he must not.\\r\\nShepherd\\r\\nLet him, my son: he shall not need to grieve\\r\\nAt knowing of thy choice.\\r\\nFLORIZEL\\r\\nCome, come, he must not.\\r\\nMark our contract.\\r\\nPOLIXENES\\r\\nMark your divorce, young sir,\\r\\nDiscovering himself\\r\\n\\r\\nWhom son I dare not call; thou art too base\\r\\nTo be acknowledged: thou a sceptre's heir,\\r\\nThat thus affect'st a sheep-hook! Thou old traitor,\\r\\nI am sorry that by hanging thee I can\\r\\nBut shorten thy life one week. And thou, fresh piece\\r\\nOf excellent witchcraft, who of force must know\\r\\nThe royal fool thou copest with,--\\r\\nShepherd\\r\\nO, my heart!\\r\\nPOLIXENES\\r\\nI'll have thy beauty scratch'd with briers, and made\\r\\nMore homely than thy state. For thee, fond boy,\\r\\nIf I may ever know thou dost but sigh\\r\\nThat thou no more shalt see this knack, as never\\r\\nI mean thou shalt, we'll bar thee from succession;\\r\\nNot hold thee of our blood, no, not our kin,\\r\\nFar than Deucalion off: mark thou my words:\\r\\nFollow us to the court. Thou churl, for this time,\\r\\nThough full of our displeasure, yet we free thee\\r\\nFrom the dead blow of it. And you, enchantment.--\\r\\nWorthy enough a herdsman: yea, him too,\\r\\nThat makes himself, but for our honour therein,\\r\\nUnworthy thee,--if ever henceforth thou\\r\\nThese rural latches to his entrance open,\\r\\nOr hoop his body more with thy embraces,\\r\\nI will devise a death as cruel for thee\\r\\nAs thou art tender to't.\\r\\nExit\\r\\n\\r\\nPERDITA\\r\\nEven here undone!\\r\\nI was not much afeard; for once or twice\\r\\nI was about to speak and tell him plainly,\\r\\nThe selfsame sun that shines upon his court\\r\\nHides not his visage from our cottage but\\r\\nLooks on alike. Will't please you, sir, be gone?\\r\\nI told you what would come of this: beseech you,\\r\\nOf your own state take care: this dream of mine,--\\r\\nBeing now awake, I'll queen it no inch farther,\\r\\nBut milk my ewes and weep.\\r\\nCAMILLO\\r\\nWhy, how now, father!\\r\\nSpeak ere thou diest.\\r\\nShepherd\\r\\nI cannot speak, nor think\\r\\nNor dare to know that which I know. O sir!\\r\\nYou have undone a man of fourscore three,\\r\\nThat thought to fill his grave in quiet, yea,\\r\\nTo die upon the bed my father died,\\r\\nTo lie close by his honest bones: but now\\r\\nSome hangman must put on my shroud and lay me\\r\\nWhere no priest shovels in dust. O cursed wretch,\\r\\nThat knew'st this was the prince,\\r\\nand wouldst adventure\\r\\nTo mingle faith with him! Undone! undone!\\r\\nIf I might die within this hour, I have lived\\r\\nTo die when I desire.\\r\\nExit\\r\\n\\r\\nFLORIZEL\\r\\nWhy look you so upon me?\\r\\nI am but sorry, not afeard; delay'd,\\r\\nBut nothing alter'd: what I was, I am;\\r\\nMore straining on for plucking back, not following\\r\\nMy leash unwillingly.\\r\\nCAMILLO\\r\\nGracious my lord,\\r\\nYou know your father's temper: at this time\\r\\nHe will allow no speech, which I do guess\\r\\nYou do not purpose to him; and as hardly\\r\\nWill he endure your sight as yet, I fear:\\r\\nThen, till the fury of his highness settle,\\r\\nCome not before him.\\r\\nFLORIZEL\\r\\nI not purpose it.\\r\\nI think, Camillo?\\r\\nCAMILLO\\r\\nEven he, my lord.\\r\\nPERDITA\\r\\nHow often have I told you 'twould be thus!\\r\\nHow often said, my dignity would last\\r\\nBut till 'twere known!\\r\\nFLORIZEL\\r\\nIt cannot fail but by\\r\\nThe violation of my faith; and then\\r\\nLet nature crush the sides o' the earth together\\r\\nAnd mar the seeds within! Lift up thy looks:\\r\\nFrom my succession wipe me, father; I\\r\\nAm heir to my affection.\\r\\nCAMILLO\\r\\nBe advised.\\r\\nFLORIZEL\\r\\nI am, and by my fancy: if my reason\\r\\nWill thereto be obedient, I have reason;\\r\\nIf not, my senses, better pleased with madness,\\r\\nDo bid it welcome.\\r\\nCAMILLO\\r\\nThis is desperate, sir.\\r\\nFLORIZEL\\r\\nSo call it: but it does fulfil my vow;\\r\\nI needs must think it honesty. Camillo,\\r\\nNot for Bohemia, nor the pomp that may\\r\\nBe thereat glean'd, for all the sun sees or\\r\\nThe close earth wombs or the profound sea hides\\r\\nIn unknown fathoms, will I break my oath\\r\\nTo this my fair beloved: therefore, I pray you,\\r\\nAs you have ever been my father's honour'd friend,\\r\\nWhen he shall miss me,--as, in faith, I mean not\\r\\nTo see him any more,--cast your good counsels\\r\\nUpon his passion; let myself and fortune\\r\\nTug for the time to come. This you may know\\r\\nAnd so deliver, I am put to sea\\r\\nWith her whom here I cannot hold on shore;\\r\\nAnd most opportune to our need I have\\r\\nA vessel rides fast by, but not prepared\\r\\nFor this design. What course I mean to hold\\r\\nShall nothing benefit your knowledge, nor\\r\\nConcern me the reporting.\\r\\nCAMILLO\\r\\nO my lord!\\r\\nI would your spirit were easier for advice,\\r\\nOr stronger for your need.\\r\\nFLORIZEL\\r\\nHark, Perdita\\r\\nDrawing her aside\\r\\n\\r\\nI'll hear you by and by.\\r\\nCAMILLO\\r\\nHe's irremoveable,\\r\\nResolved for flight. Now were I happy, if\\r\\nHis going I could frame to serve my turn,\\r\\nSave him from danger, do him love and honour,\\r\\nPurchase the sight again of dear Sicilia\\r\\nAnd that unhappy king, my master, whom\\r\\nI so much thirst to see.\\r\\nFLORIZEL\\r\\nNow, good Camillo;\\r\\nI am so fraught with curious business that\\r\\nI leave out ceremony.\\r\\nCAMILLO\\r\\nSir, I think\\r\\nYou have heard of my poor services, i' the love\\r\\nThat I have borne your father?\\r\\nFLORIZEL\\r\\nVery nobly\\r\\nHave you deserved: it is my father's music\\r\\nTo speak your deeds, not little of his care\\r\\nTo have them recompensed as thought on.\\r\\nCAMILLO\\r\\nWell, my lord,\\r\\nIf you may please to think I love the king\\r\\nAnd through him what is nearest to him, which is\\r\\nYour gracious self, embrace but my direction:\\r\\nIf your more ponderous and settled project\\r\\nMay suffer alteration, on mine honour,\\r\\nI'll point you where you shall have such receiving\\r\\nAs shall become your highness; where you may\\r\\nEnjoy your mistress, from the whom, I see,\\r\\nThere's no disjunction to be made, but by--\\r\\nAs heavens forefend!--your ruin; marry her,\\r\\nAnd, with my best endeavours in your absence,\\r\\nYour discontenting father strive to qualify\\r\\nAnd bring him up to liking.\\r\\nFLORIZEL\\r\\nHow, Camillo,\\r\\nMay this, almost a miracle, be done?\\r\\nThat I may call thee something more than man\\r\\nAnd after that trust to thee.\\r\\nCAMILLO\\r\\nHave you thought on\\r\\nA place whereto you'll go?\\r\\nFLORIZEL\\r\\nNot any yet:\\r\\nBut as the unthought-on accident is guilty\\r\\nTo what we wildly do, so we profess\\r\\nOurselves to be the slaves of chance and flies\\r\\nOf every wind that blows.\\r\\nCAMILLO\\r\\nThen list to me:\\r\\nThis follows, if you will not change your purpose\\r\\nBut undergo this flight, make for Sicilia,\\r\\nAnd there present yourself and your fair princess,\\r\\nFor so I see she must be, 'fore Leontes:\\r\\nShe shall be habited as it becomes\\r\\nThe partner of your bed. Methinks I see\\r\\nLeontes opening his free arms and weeping\\r\\nHis welcomes forth; asks thee the son forgiveness,\\r\\nAs 'twere i' the father's person; kisses the hands\\r\\nOf your fresh princess; o'er and o'er divides him\\r\\n'Twixt his unkindness and his kindness; the one\\r\\nHe chides to hell and bids the other grow\\r\\nFaster than thought or time.\\r\\nFLORIZEL\\r\\nWorthy Camillo,\\r\\nWhat colour for my visitation shall I\\r\\nHold up before him?\\r\\nCAMILLO\\r\\nSent by the king your father\\r\\nTo greet him and to give him comforts. Sir,\\r\\nThe manner of your bearing towards him, with\\r\\nWhat you as from your father shall deliver,\\r\\nThings known betwixt us three, I'll write you down:\\r\\nThe which shall point you forth at every sitting\\r\\nWhat you must say; that he shall not perceive\\r\\nBut that you have your father's bosom there\\r\\nAnd speak his very heart.\\r\\nFLORIZEL\\r\\nI am bound to you:\\r\\nThere is some sap in this.\\r\\nCAMILLO\\r\\nA cause more promising\\r\\nThan a wild dedication of yourselves\\r\\nTo unpath'd waters, undream'd shores, most certain\\r\\nTo miseries enough; no hope to help you,\\r\\nBut as you shake off one to take another;\\r\\nNothing so certain as your anchors, who\\r\\nDo their best office, if they can but stay you\\r\\nWhere you'll be loath to be: besides you know\\r\\nProsperity's the very bond of love,\\r\\nWhose fresh complexion and whose heart together\\r\\nAffliction alters.\\r\\nPERDITA\\r\\nOne of these is true:\\r\\nI think affliction may subdue the cheek,\\r\\nBut not take in the mind.\\r\\nCAMILLO\\r\\nYea, say you so?\\r\\nThere shall not at your father's house these\\r\\nseven years\\r\\nBe born another such.\\r\\nFLORIZEL\\r\\nMy good Camillo,\\r\\nShe is as forward of her breeding as\\r\\nShe is i' the rear our birth.\\r\\nCAMILLO\\r\\nI cannot say 'tis pity\\r\\nShe lacks instructions, for she seems a mistress\\r\\nTo most that teach.\\r\\nPERDITA\\r\\nYour pardon, sir; for this\\r\\nI'll blush you thanks.\\r\\nFLORIZEL\\r\\nMy prettiest Perdita!\\r\\nBut O, the thorns we stand upon! Camillo,\\r\\nPreserver of my father, now of me,\\r\\nThe medicine of our house, how shall we do?\\r\\nWe are not furnish'd like Bohemia's son,\\r\\nNor shall appear in Sicilia.\\r\\nCAMILLO\\r\\nMy lord,\\r\\nFear none of this: I think you know my fortunes\\r\\nDo all lie there: it shall be so my care\\r\\nTo have you royally appointed as if\\r\\nThe scene you play were mine. For instance, sir,\\r\\nThat you may know you shall not want, one word.\\r\\nThey talk aside\\r\\n\\r\\nRe-enter AUTOLYCUS\\r\\n\\r\\nAUTOLYCUS\\r\\nHa, ha! what a fool Honesty is! and Trust, his\\r\\nsworn brother, a very simple gentleman! I have sold\\r\\nall my trumpery; not a counterfeit stone, not a\\r\\nribbon, glass, pomander, brooch, table-book, ballad,\\r\\nknife, tape, glove, shoe-tie, bracelet, horn-ring,\\r\\nto keep my pack from fasting: they throng who\\r\\nshould buy first, as if my trinkets had been\\r\\nhallowed and brought a benediction to the buyer:\\r\\nby which means I saw whose purse was best in\\r\\npicture; and what I saw, to my good use I\\r\\nremembered. My clown, who wants but something to\\r\\nbe a reasonable man, grew so in love with the\\r\\nwenches' song, that he would not stir his pettitoes\\r\\ntill he had both tune and words; which so drew the\\r\\nrest of the herd to me that all their other senses\\r\\nstuck in ears: you might have pinched a placket, it\\r\\nwas senseless; 'twas nothing to geld a codpiece of a\\r\\npurse; I could have filed keys off that hung in\\r\\nchains: no hearing, no feeling, but my sir's song,\\r\\nand admiring the nothing of it. So that in this\\r\\ntime of lethargy I picked and cut most of their\\r\\nfestival purses; and had not the old man come in\\r\\nwith a whoo-bub against his daughter and the king's\\r\\nson and scared my choughs from the chaff, I had not\\r\\nleft a purse alive in the whole army.\\r\\nCAMILLO, FLORIZEL, and PERDITA come forward\\r\\n\\r\\nCAMILLO\\r\\nNay, but my letters, by this means being there\\r\\nSo soon as you arrive, shall clear that doubt.\\r\\nFLORIZEL\\r\\nAnd those that you'll procure from King Leontes--\\r\\nCAMILLO\\r\\nShall satisfy your father.\\r\\nPERDITA\\r\\nHappy be you!\\r\\nAll that you speak shows fair.\\r\\nCAMILLO\\r\\nWho have we here?\\r\\nSeeing AUTOLYCUS\\r\\n\\r\\nWe'll make an instrument of this, omit\\r\\nNothing may give us aid.\\r\\nAUTOLYCUS\\r\\nIf they have overheard me now, why, hanging.\\r\\nCAMILLO\\r\\nHow now, good fellow! why shakest thou so? Fear\\r\\nnot, man; here's no harm intended to thee.\\r\\nAUTOLYCUS\\r\\nI am a poor fellow, sir.\\r\\nCAMILLO\\r\\nWhy, be so still; here's nobody will steal that from\\r\\nthee: yet for the outside of thy poverty we must\\r\\nmake an exchange; therefore discase thee instantly,\\r\\n--thou must think there's a necessity in't,--and\\r\\nchange garments with this gentleman: though the\\r\\npennyworth on his side be the worst, yet hold thee,\\r\\nthere's some boot.\\r\\nAUTOLYCUS\\r\\nI am a poor fellow, sir.\\r\\nAside\\r\\n\\r\\nI know ye well enough.\\r\\nCAMILLO\\r\\nNay, prithee, dispatch: the gentleman is half\\r\\nflayed already.\\r\\nAUTOLYCUS\\r\\nAre you in earnest, sir?\\r\\nAside\\r\\n\\r\\nI smell the trick on't.\\r\\nFLORIZEL\\r\\nDispatch, I prithee.\\r\\nAUTOLYCUS\\r\\nIndeed, I have had earnest: but I cannot with\\r\\nconscience take it.\\r\\nCAMILLO\\r\\nUnbuckle, unbuckle.\\r\\nFLORIZEL and AUTOLYCUS exchange garments\\r\\n\\r\\nFortunate mistress,--let my prophecy\\r\\nCome home to ye!--you must retire yourself\\r\\nInto some covert: take your sweetheart's hat\\r\\nAnd pluck it o'er your brows, muffle your face,\\r\\nDismantle you, and, as you can, disliken\\r\\nThe truth of your own seeming; that you may--\\r\\nFor I do fear eyes over--to shipboard\\r\\nGet undescried.\\r\\nPERDITA\\r\\nI see the play so lies\\r\\nThat I must bear a part.\\r\\nCAMILLO\\r\\nNo remedy.\\r\\nHave you done there?\\r\\nFLORIZEL\\r\\nShould I now meet my father,\\r\\nHe would not call me son.\\r\\nCAMILLO\\r\\nNay, you shall have no hat.\\r\\nGiving it to PERDITA\\r\\n\\r\\nCome, lady, come. Farewell, my friend.\\r\\nAUTOLYCUS\\r\\nAdieu, sir.\\r\\nFLORIZEL\\r\\nO Perdita, what have we twain forgot!\\r\\nPray you, a word.\\r\\nCAMILLO\\r\\n[Aside] What I do next, shall be to tell the king\\r\\nOf this escape and whither they are bound;\\r\\nWherein my hope is I shall so prevail\\r\\nTo force him after: in whose company\\r\\nI shall review Sicilia, for whose sight\\r\\nI have a woman's longing.\\r\\nFLORIZEL\\r\\nFortune speed us!\\r\\nThus we set on, Camillo, to the sea-side.\\r\\nCAMILLO\\r\\nThe swifter speed the better.\\r\\nExeunt FLORIZEL, PERDITA, and CAMILLO\\r\\n\\r\\nAUTOLYCUS\\r\\nI understand the business, I hear it: to have an\\r\\nopen ear, a quick eye, and a nimble hand, is\\r\\nnecessary for a cut-purse; a good nose is requisite\\r\\nalso, to smell out work for the other senses. I see\\r\\nthis is the time that the unjust man doth thrive.\\r\\nWhat an exchange had this been without boot! What\\r\\na boot is here with this exchange! Sure the gods do\\r\\nthis year connive at us, and we may do any thing\\r\\nextempore. The prince himself is about a piece of\\r\\niniquity, stealing away from his father with his\\r\\nclog at his heels: if I thought it were a piece of\\r\\nhonesty to acquaint the king withal, I would not\\r\\ndo't: I hold it the more knavery to conceal it;\\r\\nand therein am I constant to my profession.\\r\\nRe-enter Clown and Shepherd\\r\\n\\r\\nAside, aside; here is more matter for a hot brain:\\r\\nevery lane's end, every shop, church, session,\\r\\nhanging, yields a careful man work.\\r\\nClown\\r\\nSee, see; what a man you are now!\\r\\nThere is no other way but to tell the king\\r\\nshe's a changeling and none of your flesh and blood.\\r\\nShepherd\\r\\nNay, but hear me.\\r\\nClown\\r\\nNay, but hear me.\\r\\nShepherd\\r\\nGo to, then.\\r\\nClown\\r\\nShe being none of your flesh and blood, your flesh\\r\\nand blood has not offended the king; and so your\\r\\nflesh and blood is not to be punished by him. Show\\r\\nthose things you found about her, those secret\\r\\nthings, all but what she has with her: this being\\r\\ndone, let the law go whistle: I warrant you.\\r\\nShepherd\\r\\nI will tell the king all, every word, yea, and his\\r\\nson's pranks too; who, I may say, is no honest man,\\r\\nneither to his father nor to me, to go about to make\\r\\nme the king's brother-in-law.\\r\\nClown\\r\\nIndeed, brother-in-law was the farthest off you\\r\\ncould have been to him and then your blood had been\\r\\nthe dearer by I know how much an ounce.\\r\\nAUTOLYCUS\\r\\n[Aside] Very wisely, puppies!\\r\\nShepherd\\r\\nWell, let us to the king: there is that in this\\r\\nfardel will make him scratch his beard.\\r\\nAUTOLYCUS\\r\\n[Aside] I know not what impediment this complaint\\r\\nmay be to the flight of my master.\\r\\nClown\\r\\nPray heartily he be at palace.\\r\\nAUTOLYCUS\\r\\n[Aside] Though I am not naturally honest, I am so\\r\\nsometimes by chance: let me pocket up my pedlar's excrement.\\r\\nTakes off his false beard\\r\\n\\r\\nHow now, rustics! whither are you bound?\\r\\nShepherd\\r\\nTo the palace, an it like your worship.\\r\\nAUTOLYCUS\\r\\nYour affairs there, what, with whom, the condition\\r\\nof that fardel, the place of your dwelling, your\\r\\nnames, your ages, of what having, breeding, and any\\r\\nthing that is fitting to be known, discover.\\r\\nClown\\r\\nWe are but plain fellows, sir.\\r\\nAUTOLYCUS\\r\\nA lie; you are rough and hairy. Let me have no\\r\\nlying: it becomes none but tradesmen, and they\\r\\noften give us soldiers the lie: but we pay them for\\r\\nit with stamped coin, not stabbing steel; therefore\\r\\nthey do not give us the lie.\\r\\nClown\\r\\nYour worship had like to have given us one, if you\\r\\nhad not taken yourself with the manner.\\r\\nShepherd\\r\\nAre you a courtier, an't like you, sir?\\r\\nAUTOLYCUS\\r\\nWhether it like me or no, I am a courtier. Seest\\r\\nthou not the air of the court in these enfoldings?\\r\\nhath not my gait in it the measure of the court?\\r\\nreceives not thy nose court-odor from me? reflect I\\r\\nnot on thy baseness court-contempt? Thinkest thou,\\r\\nfor that I insinuate, or toaze from thee thy\\r\\nbusiness, I am therefore no courtier? I am courtier\\r\\ncap-a-pe; and one that will either push on or pluck\\r\\nback thy business there: whereupon I command thee to\\r\\nopen thy affair.\\r\\nShepherd\\r\\nMy business, sir, is to the king.\\r\\nAUTOLYCUS\\r\\nWhat advocate hast thou to him?\\r\\nShepherd\\r\\nI know not, an't like you.\\r\\nClown\\r\\nAdvocate's the court-word for a pheasant: say you\\r\\nhave none.\\r\\nShepherd\\r\\nNone, sir; I have no pheasant, cock nor hen.\\r\\nAUTOLYCUS\\r\\nHow blessed are we that are not simple men!\\r\\nYet nature might have made me as these are,\\r\\nTherefore I will not disdain.\\r\\nClown\\r\\nThis cannot be but a great courtier.\\r\\nShepherd\\r\\nHis garments are rich, but he wears\\r\\nthem not handsomely.\\r\\nClown\\r\\nHe seems to be the more noble in being fantastical:\\r\\na great man, I'll warrant; I know by the picking\\r\\non's teeth.\\r\\nAUTOLYCUS\\r\\nThe fardel there? what's i' the fardel?\\r\\nWherefore that box?\\r\\nShepherd\\r\\nSir, there lies such secrets in this fardel and box,\\r\\nwhich none must know but the king; and which he\\r\\nshall know within this hour, if I may come to the\\r\\nspeech of him.\\r\\nAUTOLYCUS\\r\\nAge, thou hast lost thy labour.\\r\\nShepherd\\r\\nWhy, sir?\\r\\nAUTOLYCUS\\r\\nThe king is not at the palace; he is gone aboard a\\r\\nnew ship to purge melancholy and air himself: for,\\r\\nif thou beest capable of things serious, thou must\\r\\nknow the king is full of grief.\\r\\nShepard\\r\\nSo 'tis said, sir; about his son, that should have\\r\\nmarried a shepherd's daughter.\\r\\nAUTOLYCUS\\r\\nIf that shepherd be not in hand-fast, let him fly:\\r\\nthe curses he shall have, the tortures he shall\\r\\nfeel, will break the back of man, the heart of monster.\\r\\nClown\\r\\nThink you so, sir?\\r\\nAUTOLYCUS\\r\\nNot he alone shall suffer what wit can make heavy\\r\\nand vengeance bitter; but those that are germane to\\r\\nhim, though removed fifty times, shall all come\\r\\nunder the hangman: which though it be great pity,\\r\\nyet it is necessary. An old sheep-whistling rogue a\\r\\nram-tender, to offer to have his daughter come into\\r\\ngrace! Some say he shall be stoned; but that death\\r\\nis too soft for him, say I draw our throne into a\\r\\nsheep-cote! all deaths are too few, the sharpest too easy.\\r\\nClown\\r\\nHas the old man e'er a son, sir, do you hear. an't\\r\\nlike you, sir?\\r\\nAUTOLYCUS\\r\\nHe has a son, who shall be flayed alive; then\\r\\n'nointed over with honey, set on the head of a\\r\\nwasp's nest; then stand till he be three quarters\\r\\nand a dram dead; then recovered again with\\r\\naqua-vitae or some other hot infusion; then, raw as\\r\\nhe is, and in the hottest day prognostication\\r\\nproclaims, shall be be set against a brick-wall, the\\r\\nsun looking with a southward eye upon him, where he\\r\\nis to behold him with flies blown to death. But what\\r\\ntalk we of these traitorly rascals, whose miseries\\r\\nare to be smiled at, their offences being so\\r\\ncapital? Tell me, for you seem to be honest plain\\r\\nmen, what you have to the king: being something\\r\\ngently considered, I'll bring you where he is\\r\\naboard, tender your persons to his presence,\\r\\nwhisper him in your behalfs; and if it be in man\\r\\nbesides the king to effect your suits, here is man\\r\\nshall do it.\\r\\nClown\\r\\nHe seems to be of great authority: close with him,\\r\\ngive him gold; and though authority be a stubborn\\r\\nbear, yet he is oft led by the nose with gold: show\\r\\nthe inside of your purse to the outside of his hand,\\r\\nand no more ado. Remember 'stoned,' and 'flayed alive.'\\r\\nShepherd\\r\\nAn't please you, sir, to undertake the business for\\r\\nus, here is that gold I have: I'll make it as much\\r\\nmore and leave this young man in pawn till I bring it you.\\r\\nAUTOLYCUS\\r\\nAfter I have done what I promised?\\r\\nShepherd\\r\\nAy, sir.\\r\\nAUTOLYCUS\\r\\nWell, give me the moiety. Are you a party in this business?\\r\\nClown\\r\\nIn some sort, sir: but though my case be a pitiful\\r\\none, I hope I shall not be flayed out of it.\\r\\nAUTOLYCUS\\r\\nO, that's the case of the shepherd's son: hang him,\\r\\nhe'll be made an example.\\r\\nClown\\r\\nComfort, good comfort! We must to the king and show\\r\\nour strange sights: he must know 'tis none of your\\r\\ndaughter nor my sister; we are gone else. Sir, I\\r\\nwill give you as much as this old man does when the\\r\\nbusiness is performed, and remain, as he says, your\\r\\npawn till it be brought you.\\r\\nAUTOLYCUS\\r\\nI will trust you. Walk before toward the sea-side;\\r\\ngo on the right hand: I will but look upon the\\r\\nhedge and follow you.\\r\\nClown\\r\\nWe are blest in this man, as I may say, even blest.\\r\\nShepherd\\r\\nLet's before as he bids us: he was provided to do us good.\\r\\nExeunt Shepherd and Clown\\r\\n\\r\\nAUTOLYCUS\\r\\nIf I had a mind to be honest, I see Fortune would\\r\\nnot suffer me: she drops booties in my mouth. I am\\r\\ncourted now with a double occasion, gold and a means\\r\\nto do the prince my master good; which who knows how\\r\\nthat may turn back to my advancement? I will bring\\r\\nthese two moles, these blind ones, aboard him: if he\\r\\nthink it fit to shore them again and that the\\r\\ncomplaint they have to the king concerns him\\r\\nnothing, let him call me rogue for being so far\\r\\nofficious; for I am proof against that title and\\r\\nwhat shame else belongs to't. To him will I present\\r\\nthem: there may be matter in it.\\r\\nExit\\r\\n\\r\\nACT V\\r\\nSCENE I. A room in LEONTES' palace.\\r\\nEnter LEONTES, CLEOMENES, DION, PAULINA, and Servants\\r\\nCLEOMENES\\r\\nSir, you have done enough, and have perform'd\\r\\nA saint-like sorrow: no fault could you make,\\r\\nWhich you have not redeem'd; indeed, paid down\\r\\nMore penitence than done trespass: at the last,\\r\\nDo as the heavens have done, forget your evil;\\r\\nWith them forgive yourself.\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nWhilst I remember\\r\\nHer and her virtues, I cannot forget\\r\\nMy blemishes in them, and so still think of\\r\\nThe wrong I did myself; which was so much,\\r\\nThat heirless it hath made my kingdom and\\r\\nDestroy'd the sweet'st companion that e'er man\\r\\nBred his hopes out of.\\r\\nPAULINA\\r\\nTrue, too true, my lord:\\r\\nIf, one by one, you wedded all the world,\\r\\nOr from the all that are took something good,\\r\\nTo make a perfect woman, she you kill'd\\r\\nWould be unparallel'd.\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nI think so. Kill'd!\\r\\nShe I kill'd! I did so: but thou strikest me\\r\\nSorely, to say I did; it is as bitter\\r\\nUpon thy tongue as in my thought: now, good now,\\r\\nSay so but seldom.\\r\\nCLEOMENES\\r\\nNot at all, good lady:\\r\\nYou might have spoken a thousand things that would\\r\\nHave done the time more benefit and graced\\r\\nYour kindness better.\\r\\nPAULINA\\r\\nYou are one of those\\r\\nWould have him wed again.\\r\\nDION\\r\\nIf you would not so,\\r\\nYou pity not the state, nor the remembrance\\r\\nOf his most sovereign name; consider little\\r\\nWhat dangers, by his highness' fail of issue,\\r\\nMay drop upon his kingdom and devour\\r\\nIncertain lookers on. What were more holy\\r\\nThan to rejoice the former queen is well?\\r\\nWhat holier than, for royalty's repair,\\r\\nFor present comfort and for future good,\\r\\nTo bless the bed of majesty again\\r\\nWith a sweet fellow to't?\\r\\nPAULINA\\r\\nThere is none worthy,\\r\\nRespecting her that's gone. Besides, the gods\\r\\nWill have fulfill'd their secret purposes;\\r\\nFor has not the divine Apollo said,\\r\\nIs't not the tenor of his oracle,\\r\\nThat King Leontes shall not have an heir\\r\\nTill his lost child be found? which that it shall,\\r\\nIs all as monstrous to our human reason\\r\\nAs my Antigonus to break his grave\\r\\nAnd come again to me; who, on my life,\\r\\nDid perish with the infant. 'Tis your counsel\\r\\nMy lord should to the heavens be contrary,\\r\\nOppose against their wills.\\r\\nTo LEONTES\\r\\n\\r\\nCare not for issue;\\r\\nThe crown will find an heir: great Alexander\\r\\nLeft his to the worthiest; so his successor\\r\\nWas like to be the best.\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nGood Paulina,\\r\\nWho hast the memory of Hermione,\\r\\nI know, in honour, O, that ever I\\r\\nHad squared me to thy counsel! then, even now,\\r\\nI might have look'd upon my queen's full eyes,\\r\\nHave taken treasure from her lips--\\r\\nPAULINA\\r\\nAnd left them\\r\\nMore rich for what they yielded.\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nThou speak'st truth.\\r\\nNo more such wives; therefore, no wife: one worse,\\r\\nAnd better used, would make her sainted spirit\\r\\nAgain possess her corpse, and on this stage,\\r\\nWhere we're offenders now, appear soul-vex'd,\\r\\nAnd begin, 'Why to me?'\\r\\nPAULINA\\r\\nHad she such power,\\r\\nShe had just cause.\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nShe had; and would incense me\\r\\nTo murder her I married.\\r\\nPAULINA\\r\\nI should so.\\r\\nWere I the ghost that walk'd, I'ld bid you mark\\r\\nHer eye, and tell me for what dull part in't\\r\\nYou chose her; then I'ld shriek, that even your ears\\r\\nShould rift to hear me; and the words that follow'd\\r\\nShould be 'Remember mine.'\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nStars, stars,\\r\\nAnd all eyes else dead coals! Fear thou no wife;\\r\\nI'll have no wife, Paulina.\\r\\nPAULINA\\r\\nWill you swear\\r\\nNever to marry but by my free leave?\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nNever, Paulina; so be blest my spirit!\\r\\nPAULINA\\r\\nThen, good my lords, bear witness to his oath.\\r\\nCLEOMENES\\r\\nYou tempt him over-much.\\r\\nPAULINA\\r\\nUnless another,\\r\\nAs like Hermione as is her picture,\\r\\nAffront his eye.\\r\\nCLEOMENES\\r\\nGood madam,--\\r\\nPAULINA\\r\\nI have done.\\r\\nYet, if my lord will marry,--if you will, sir,\\r\\nNo remedy, but you will,--give me the office\\r\\nTo choose you a queen: she shall not be so young\\r\\nAs was your former; but she shall be such\\r\\nAs, walk'd your first queen's ghost,\\r\\nit should take joy\\r\\nTo see her in your arms.\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nMy true Paulina,\\r\\nWe shall not marry till thou bid'st us.\\r\\nPAULINA\\r\\nThat\\r\\nShall be when your first queen's again in breath;\\r\\nNever till then.\\r\\nEnter a Gentleman\\r\\n\\r\\nGentleman\\r\\nOne that gives out himself Prince Florizel,\\r\\nSon of Polixenes, with his princess, she\\r\\nThe fairest I have yet beheld, desires access\\r\\nTo your high presence.\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nWhat with him? he comes not\\r\\nLike to his father's greatness: his approach,\\r\\nSo out of circumstance and sudden, tells us\\r\\n'Tis not a visitation framed, but forced\\r\\nBy need and accident. What train?\\r\\nGentleman\\r\\nBut few,\\r\\nAnd those but mean.\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nHis princess, say you, with him?\\r\\nGentleman\\r\\nAy, the most peerless piece of earth, I think,\\r\\nThat e'er the sun shone bright on.\\r\\nPAULINA\\r\\nO Hermione,\\r\\nAs every present time doth boast itself\\r\\nAbove a better gone, so must thy grave\\r\\nGive way to what's seen now! Sir, you yourself\\r\\nHave said and writ so, but your writing now\\r\\nIs colder than that theme, 'She had not been,\\r\\nNor was not to be equall'd;'--thus your verse\\r\\nFlow'd with her beauty once: 'tis shrewdly ebb'd,\\r\\nTo say you have seen a better.\\r\\nGentleman\\r\\nPardon, madam:\\r\\nThe one I have almost forgot,--your pardon,--\\r\\nThe other, when she has obtain'd your eye,\\r\\nWill have your tongue too. This is a creature,\\r\\nWould she begin a sect, might quench the zeal\\r\\nOf all professors else, make proselytes\\r\\nOf who she but bid follow.\\r\\nPAULINA\\r\\nHow! not women?\\r\\nGentleman\\r\\nWomen will love her, that she is a woman\\r\\nMore worth than any man; men, that she is\\r\\nThe rarest of all women.\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nGo, Cleomenes;\\r\\nYourself, assisted with your honour'd friends,\\r\\nBring them to our embracement. Still, 'tis strange\\r\\nExeunt CLEOMENES and others\\r\\n\\r\\nHe thus should steal upon us.\\r\\nPAULINA\\r\\nHad our prince,\\r\\nJewel of children, seen this hour, he had pair'd\\r\\nWell with this lord: there was not full a month\\r\\nBetween their births.\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nPrithee, no more; cease; thou know'st\\r\\nHe dies to me again when talk'd of: sure,\\r\\nWhen I shall see this gentleman, thy speeches\\r\\nWill bring me to consider that which may\\r\\nUnfurnish me of reason. They are come.\\r\\nRe-enter CLEOMENES and others, with FLORIZEL and PERDITA\\r\\n\\r\\nYour mother was most true to wedlock, prince;\\r\\nFor she did print your royal father off,\\r\\nConceiving you: were I but twenty-one,\\r\\nYour father's image is so hit in you,\\r\\nHis very air, that I should call you brother,\\r\\nAs I did him, and speak of something wildly\\r\\nBy us perform'd before. Most dearly welcome!\\r\\nAnd your fair princess,--goddess!--O, alas!\\r\\nI lost a couple, that 'twixt heaven and earth\\r\\nMight thus have stood begetting wonder as\\r\\nYou, gracious couple, do: and then I lost--\\r\\nAll mine own folly--the society,\\r\\nAmity too, of your brave father, whom,\\r\\nThough bearing misery, I desire my life\\r\\nOnce more to look on him.\\r\\nFLORIZEL\\r\\nBy his command\\r\\nHave I here touch'd Sicilia and from him\\r\\nGive you all greetings that a king, at friend,\\r\\nCan send his brother: and, but infirmity\\r\\nWhich waits upon worn times hath something seized\\r\\nHis wish'd ability, he had himself\\r\\nThe lands and waters 'twixt your throne and his\\r\\nMeasured to look upon you; whom he loves--\\r\\nHe bade me say so--more than all the sceptres\\r\\nAnd those that bear them living.\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nO my brother,\\r\\nGood gentleman! the wrongs I have done thee stir\\r\\nAfresh within me, and these thy offices,\\r\\nSo rarely kind, are as interpreters\\r\\nOf my behind-hand slackness. Welcome hither,\\r\\nAs is the spring to the earth. And hath he too\\r\\nExposed this paragon to the fearful usage,\\r\\nAt least ungentle, of the dreadful Neptune,\\r\\nTo greet a man not worth her pains, much less\\r\\nThe adventure of her person?\\r\\nFLORIZEL\\r\\nGood my lord,\\r\\nShe came from Libya.\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nWhere the warlike Smalus,\\r\\nThat noble honour'd lord, is fear'd and loved?\\r\\nFLORIZEL\\r\\nMost royal sir, from thence; from him, whose daughter\\r\\nHis tears proclaim'd his, parting with her: thence,\\r\\nA prosperous south-wind friendly, we have cross'd,\\r\\nTo execute the charge my father gave me\\r\\nFor visiting your highness: my best train\\r\\nI have from your Sicilian shores dismiss'd;\\r\\nWho for Bohemia bend, to signify\\r\\nNot only my success in Libya, sir,\\r\\nBut my arrival and my wife's in safety\\r\\nHere where we are.\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nThe blessed gods\\r\\nPurge all infection from our air whilst you\\r\\nDo climate here! You have a holy father,\\r\\nA graceful gentleman; against whose person,\\r\\nSo sacred as it is, I have done sin:\\r\\nFor which the heavens, taking angry note,\\r\\nHave left me issueless; and your father's blest,\\r\\nAs he from heaven merits it, with you\\r\\nWorthy his goodness. What might I have been,\\r\\nMight I a son and daughter now have look'd on,\\r\\nSuch goodly things as you!\\r\\nEnter a Lord\\r\\n\\r\\nLord\\r\\nMost noble sir,\\r\\nThat which I shall report will bear no credit,\\r\\nWere not the proof so nigh. Please you, great sir,\\r\\nBohemia greets you from himself by me;\\r\\nDesires you to attach his son, who has--\\r\\nHis dignity and duty both cast off--\\r\\nFled from his father, from his hopes, and with\\r\\nA shepherd's daughter.\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nWhere's Bohemia? speak.\\r\\nLord\\r\\nHere in your city; I now came from him:\\r\\nI speak amazedly; and it becomes\\r\\nMy marvel and my message. To your court\\r\\nWhiles he was hastening, in the chase, it seems,\\r\\nOf this fair couple, meets he on the way\\r\\nThe father of this seeming lady and\\r\\nHer brother, having both their country quitted\\r\\nWith this young prince.\\r\\nFLORIZEL\\r\\nCamillo has betray'd me;\\r\\nWhose honour and whose honesty till now\\r\\nEndured all weathers.\\r\\nLord\\r\\nLay't so to his charge:\\r\\nHe's with the king your father.\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nWho? Camillo?\\r\\nLord\\r\\nCamillo, sir; I spake with him; who now\\r\\nHas these poor men in question. Never saw I\\r\\nWretches so quake: they kneel, they kiss the earth;\\r\\nForswear themselves as often as they speak:\\r\\nBohemia stops his ears, and threatens them\\r\\nWith divers deaths in death.\\r\\nPERDITA\\r\\nO my poor father!\\r\\nThe heaven sets spies upon us, will not have\\r\\nOur contract celebrated.\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nYou are married?\\r\\nFLORIZEL\\r\\nWe are not, sir, nor are we like to be;\\r\\nThe stars, I see, will kiss the valleys first:\\r\\nThe odds for high and low's alike.\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nMy lord,\\r\\nIs this the daughter of a king?\\r\\nFLORIZEL\\r\\nShe is,\\r\\nWhen once she is my wife.\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nThat 'once' I see by your good father's speed\\r\\nWill come on very slowly. I am sorry,\\r\\nMost sorry, you have broken from his liking\\r\\nWhere you were tied in duty, and as sorry\\r\\nYour choice is not so rich in worth as beauty,\\r\\nThat you might well enjoy her.\\r\\nFLORIZEL\\r\\nDear, look up:\\r\\nThough Fortune, visible an enemy,\\r\\nShould chase us with my father, power no jot\\r\\nHath she to change our loves. Beseech you, sir,\\r\\nRemember since you owed no more to time\\r\\nThan I do now: with thought of such affections,\\r\\nStep forth mine advocate; at your request\\r\\nMy father will grant precious things as trifles.\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nWould he do so, I'ld beg your precious mistress,\\r\\nWhich he counts but a trifle.\\r\\nPAULINA\\r\\nSir, my liege,\\r\\nYour eye hath too much youth in't: not a month\\r\\n'Fore your queen died, she was more worth such gazes\\r\\nThan what you look on now.\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nI thought of her,\\r\\nEven in these looks I made.\\r\\nTo FLORIZEL\\r\\n\\r\\nBut your petition\\r\\nIs yet unanswer'd. I will to your father:\\r\\nYour honour not o'erthrown by your desires,\\r\\nI am friend to them and you: upon which errand\\r\\nI now go toward him; therefore follow me\\r\\nAnd mark what way I make: come, good my lord.\\r\\nExeunt\\r\\n\\r\\nSCENE II. Before LEONTES' palace.\\r\\nEnter AUTOLYCUS and a Gentleman\\r\\nAUTOLYCUS\\r\\nBeseech you, sir, were you present at this relation?\\r\\nFirst Gentleman\\r\\nI was by at the opening of the fardel, heard the old\\r\\nshepherd deliver the manner how he found it:\\r\\nwhereupon, after a little amazedness, we were all\\r\\ncommanded out of the chamber; only this methought I\\r\\nheard the shepherd say, he found the child.\\r\\nAUTOLYCUS\\r\\nI would most gladly know the issue of it.\\r\\nFirst Gentleman\\r\\nI make a broken delivery of the business; but the\\r\\nchanges I perceived in the king and Camillo were\\r\\nvery notes of admiration: they seemed almost, with\\r\\nstaring on one another, to tear the cases of their\\r\\neyes; there was speech in their dumbness, language\\r\\nin their very gesture; they looked as they had heard\\r\\nof a world ransomed, or one destroyed: a notable\\r\\npassion of wonder appeared in them; but the wisest\\r\\nbeholder, that knew no more but seeing, could not\\r\\nsay if the importance were joy or sorrow; but in the\\r\\nextremity of the one, it must needs be.\\r\\nEnter another Gentleman\\r\\n\\r\\nHere comes a gentleman that haply knows more.\\r\\nThe news, Rogero?\\r\\nSecond Gentleman\\r\\nNothing but bonfires: the oracle is fulfilled; the\\r\\nking's daughter is found: such a deal of wonder is\\r\\nbroken out within this hour that ballad-makers\\r\\ncannot be able to express it.\\r\\nEnter a third Gentleman\\r\\n\\r\\nHere comes the Lady Paulina's steward: he can\\r\\ndeliver you more. How goes it now, sir? this news\\r\\nwhich is called true is so like an old tale, that\\r\\nthe verity of it is in strong suspicion: has the king\\r\\nfound his heir?\\r\\nThird Gentleman\\r\\nMost true, if ever truth were pregnant by\\r\\ncircumstance: that which you hear you'll swear you\\r\\nsee, there is such unity in the proofs. The mantle\\r\\nof Queen Hermione's, her jewel about the neck of it,\\r\\nthe letters of Antigonus found with it which they\\r\\nknow to be his character, the majesty of the\\r\\ncreature in resemblance of the mother, the affection\\r\\nof nobleness which nature shows above her breeding,\\r\\nand many other evidences proclaim her with all\\r\\ncertainty to be the king's daughter. Did you see\\r\\nthe meeting of the two kings?\\r\\nSecond Gentleman\\r\\nNo.\\r\\nThird Gentleman\\r\\nThen have you lost a sight, which was to be seen,\\r\\ncannot be spoken of. There might you have beheld one\\r\\njoy crown another, so and in such manner that it\\r\\nseemed sorrow wept to take leave of them, for their\\r\\njoy waded in tears. There was casting up of eyes,\\r\\nholding up of hands, with countenances of such\\r\\ndistraction that they were to be known by garment,\\r\\nnot by favour. Our king, being ready to leap out of\\r\\nhimself for joy of his found daughter, as if that\\r\\njoy were now become a loss, cries 'O, thy mother,\\r\\nthy mother!' then asks Bohemia forgiveness; then\\r\\nembraces his son-in-law; then again worries he his\\r\\ndaughter with clipping her; now he thanks the old\\r\\nshepherd, which stands by like a weather-bitten\\r\\nconduit of many kings' reigns. I never heard of such\\r\\nanother encounter, which lames report to follow it\\r\\nand undoes description to do it.\\r\\nSecond Gentleman\\r\\nWhat, pray you, became of Antigonus, that carried\\r\\nhence the child?\\r\\nThird Gentleman\\r\\nLike an old tale still, which will have matter to\\r\\nrehearse, though credit be asleep and not an ear\\r\\nopen. He was torn to pieces with a bear: this\\r\\navouches the shepherd's son; who has not only his\\r\\ninnocence, which seems much, to justify him, but a\\r\\nhandkerchief and rings of his that Paulina knows.\\r\\nFirst Gentleman\\r\\nWhat became of his bark and his followers?\\r\\nThird Gentleman\\r\\nWrecked the same instant of their master's death and\\r\\nin the view of the shepherd: so that all the\\r\\ninstruments which aided to expose the child were\\r\\neven then lost when it was found. But O, the noble\\r\\ncombat that 'twixt joy and sorrow was fought in\\r\\nPaulina! She had one eye declined for the loss of\\r\\nher husband, another elevated that the oracle was\\r\\nfulfilled: she lifted the princess from the earth,\\r\\nand so locks her in embracing, as if she would pin\\r\\nher to her heart that she might no more be in danger\\r\\nof losing.\\r\\nFirst Gentleman\\r\\nThe dignity of this act was worth the audience of\\r\\nkings and princes; for by such was it acted.\\r\\nThird Gentleman\\r\\nOne of the prettiest touches of all and that which\\r\\nangled for mine eyes, caught the water though not\\r\\nthe fish, was when, at the relation of the queen's\\r\\ndeath, with the manner how she came to't bravely\\r\\nconfessed and lamented by the king, how\\r\\nattentiveness wounded his daughter; till, from one\\r\\nsign of dolour to another, she did, with an 'Alas,'\\r\\nI would fain say, bleed tears, for I am sure my\\r\\nheart wept blood. Who was most marble there changed\\r\\ncolour; some swooned, all sorrowed: if all the world\\r\\ncould have seen 't, the woe had been universal.\\r\\nFirst Gentleman\\r\\nAre they returned to the court?\\r\\nThird Gentleman\\r\\nNo: the princess hearing of her mother's statue,\\r\\nwhich is in the keeping of Paulina,--a piece many\\r\\nyears in doing and now newly performed by that rare\\r\\nItalian master, Julio Romano, who, had he himself\\r\\neternity and could put breath into his work, would\\r\\nbeguile Nature of her custom, so perfectly he is her\\r\\nape: he so near to Hermione hath done Hermione that\\r\\nthey say one would speak to her and stand in hope of\\r\\nanswer: thither with all greediness of affection\\r\\nare they gone, and there they intend to sup.\\r\\nSecond Gentleman\\r\\nI thought she had some great matter there in hand;\\r\\nfor she hath privately twice or thrice a day, ever\\r\\nsince the death of Hermione, visited that removed\\r\\nhouse. Shall we thither and with our company piece\\r\\nthe rejoicing?\\r\\nFirst Gentleman\\r\\nWho would be thence that has the benefit of access?\\r\\nevery wink of an eye some new grace will be born:\\r\\nour absence makes us unthrifty to our knowledge.\\r\\nLet's along.\\r\\nExeunt Gentlemen\\r\\n\\r\\nAUTOLYCUS\\r\\nNow, had I not the dash of my former life in me,\\r\\nwould preferment drop on my head. I brought the old\\r\\nman and his son aboard the prince: told him I heard\\r\\nthem talk of a fardel and I know not what: but he\\r\\nat that time, overfond of the shepherd's daughter,\\r\\nso he then took her to be, who began to be much\\r\\nsea-sick, and himself little better, extremity of\\r\\nweather continuing, this mystery remained\\r\\nundiscovered. But 'tis all one to me; for had I\\r\\nbeen the finder out of this secret, it would not\\r\\nhave relished among my other discredits.\\r\\nEnter Shepherd and Clown\\r\\n\\r\\nHere come those I have done good to against my will,\\r\\nand already appearing in the blossoms of their fortune.\\r\\nShepherd\\r\\nCome, boy; I am past moe children, but thy sons and\\r\\ndaughters will be all gentlemen born.\\r\\nClown\\r\\nYou are well met, sir. You denied to fight with me\\r\\nthis other day, because I was no gentleman born.\\r\\nSee you these clothes? say you see them not and\\r\\nthink me still no gentleman born: you were best say\\r\\nthese robes are not gentlemen born: give me the\\r\\nlie, do, and try whether I am not now a gentleman born.\\r\\nAUTOLYCUS\\r\\nI know you are now, sir, a gentleman born.\\r\\nClown\\r\\nAy, and have been so any time these four hours.\\r\\nShepherd\\r\\nAnd so have I, boy.\\r\\nClown\\r\\nSo you have: but I was a gentleman born before my\\r\\nfather; for the king's son took me by the hand, and\\r\\ncalled me brother; and then the two kings called my\\r\\nfather brother; and then the prince my brother and\\r\\nthe princess my sister called my father father; and\\r\\nso we wept, and there was the first gentleman-like\\r\\ntears that ever we shed.\\r\\nShepherd\\r\\nWe may live, son, to shed many more.\\r\\nClown\\r\\nAy; or else 'twere hard luck, being in so\\r\\npreposterous estate as we are.\\r\\nAUTOLYCUS\\r\\nI humbly beseech you, sir, to pardon me all the\\r\\nfaults I have committed to your worship and to give\\r\\nme your good report to the prince my master.\\r\\nShepherd\\r\\nPrithee, son, do; for we must be gentle, now we are\\r\\ngentlemen.\\r\\nClown\\r\\nThou wilt amend thy life?\\r\\nAUTOLYCUS\\r\\nAy, an it like your good worship.\\r\\nClown\\r\\nGive me thy hand: I will swear to the prince thou\\r\\nart as honest a true fellow as any is in Bohemia.\\r\\nShepherd\\r\\nYou may say it, but not swear it.\\r\\nClown\\r\\nNot swear it, now I am a gentleman? Let boors and\\r\\nfranklins say it, I'll swear it.\\r\\nShepherd\\r\\nHow if it be false, son?\\r\\nClown\\r\\nIf it be ne'er so false, a true gentleman may swear\\r\\nit in the behalf of his friend: and I'll swear to\\r\\nthe prince thou art a tall fellow of thy hands and\\r\\nthat thou wilt not be drunk; but I know thou art no\\r\\ntall fellow of thy hands and that thou wilt be\\r\\ndrunk: but I'll swear it, and I would thou wouldst\\r\\nbe a tall fellow of thy hands.\\r\\nAUTOLYCUS\\r\\nI will prove so, sir, to my power.\\r\\nClown\\r\\nAy, by any means prove a tall fellow: if I do not\\r\\nwonder how thou darest venture to be drunk, not\\r\\nbeing a tall fellow, trust me not. Hark! the kings\\r\\nand the princes, our kindred, are going to see the\\r\\nqueen's picture. Come, follow us: we'll be thy\\r\\ngood masters.\\r\\nExeunt\\r\\n\\r\\nSCENE III. A chapel in PAULINA'S house.\\r\\nEnter LEONTES, POLIXENES, FLORIZEL, PERDITA, CAMILLO, PAULINA, Lords, and Attendants\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nO grave and good Paulina, the great comfort\\r\\nThat I have had of thee!\\r\\nPAULINA\\r\\nWhat, sovereign sir,\\r\\nI did not well I meant well. All my services\\r\\nYou have paid home: but that you have vouchsafed,\\r\\nWith your crown'd brother and these your contracted\\r\\nHeirs of your kingdoms, my poor house to visit,\\r\\nIt is a surplus of your grace, which never\\r\\nMy life may last to answer.\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nO Paulina,\\r\\nWe honour you with trouble: but we came\\r\\nTo see the statue of our queen: your gallery\\r\\nHave we pass'd through, not without much content\\r\\nIn many singularities; but we saw not\\r\\nThat which my daughter came to look upon,\\r\\nThe statue of her mother.\\r\\nPAULINA\\r\\nAs she lived peerless,\\r\\nSo her dead likeness, I do well believe,\\r\\nExcels whatever yet you look'd upon\\r\\nOr hand of man hath done; therefore I keep it\\r\\nLonely, apart. But here it is: prepare\\r\\nTo see the life as lively mock'd as ever\\r\\nStill sleep mock'd death: behold, and say 'tis well.\\r\\nPAULINA draws a curtain, and discovers HERMIONE standing like a statue\\r\\n\\r\\nI like your silence, it the more shows off\\r\\nYour wonder: but yet speak; first, you, my liege,\\r\\nComes it not something near?\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nHer natural posture!\\r\\nChide me, dear stone, that I may say indeed\\r\\nThou art Hermione; or rather, thou art she\\r\\nIn thy not chiding, for she was as tender\\r\\nAs infancy and grace. But yet, Paulina,\\r\\nHermione was not so much wrinkled, nothing\\r\\nSo aged as this seems.\\r\\nPOLIXENES\\r\\nO, not by much.\\r\\nPAULINA\\r\\nSo much the more our carver's excellence;\\r\\nWhich lets go by some sixteen years and makes her\\r\\nAs she lived now.\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nAs now she might have done,\\r\\nSo much to my good comfort, as it is\\r\\nNow piercing to my soul. O, thus she stood,\\r\\nEven with such life of majesty, warm life,\\r\\nAs now it coldly stands, when first I woo'd her!\\r\\nI am ashamed: does not the stone rebuke me\\r\\nFor being more stone than it? O royal piece,\\r\\nThere's magic in thy majesty, which has\\r\\nMy evils conjured to remembrance and\\r\\nFrom thy admiring daughter took the spirits,\\r\\nStanding like stone with thee.\\r\\nPERDITA\\r\\nAnd give me leave,\\r\\nAnd do not say 'tis superstition, that\\r\\nI kneel and then implore her blessing. Lady,\\r\\nDear queen, that ended when I but began,\\r\\nGive me that hand of yours to kiss.\\r\\nPAULINA\\r\\nO, patience!\\r\\nThe statue is but newly fix'd, the colour's Not dry.\\r\\nCAMILLO\\r\\nMy lord, your sorrow was too sore laid on,\\r\\nWhich sixteen winters cannot blow away,\\r\\nSo many summers dry; scarce any joy\\r\\nDid ever so long live; no sorrow\\r\\nBut kill'd itself much sooner.\\r\\nPOLIXENES\\r\\nDear my brother,\\r\\nLet him that was the cause of this have power\\r\\nTo take off so much grief from you as he\\r\\nWill piece up in himself.\\r\\nPAULINA\\r\\nIndeed, my lord,\\r\\nIf I had thought the sight of my poor image\\r\\nWould thus have wrought you,--for the stone is mine--\\r\\nI'ld not have show'd it.\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nDo not draw the curtain.\\r\\nPAULINA\\r\\nNo longer shall you gaze on't, lest your fancy\\r\\nMay think anon it moves.\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nLet be, let be.\\r\\nWould I were dead, but that, methinks, already--\\r\\nWhat was he that did make it? See, my lord,\\r\\nWould you not deem it breathed? and that those veins\\r\\nDid verily bear blood?\\r\\nPOLIXENES\\r\\nMasterly done:\\r\\nThe very life seems warm upon her lip.\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nThe fixture of her eye has motion in't,\\r\\nAs we are mock'd with art.\\r\\nPAULINA\\r\\nI'll draw the curtain:\\r\\nMy lord's almost so far transported that\\r\\nHe'll think anon it lives.\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nO sweet Paulina,\\r\\nMake me to think so twenty years together!\\r\\nNo settled senses of the world can match\\r\\nThe pleasure of that madness. Let 't alone.\\r\\nPAULINA\\r\\nI am sorry, sir, I have thus far stirr'd you: but\\r\\nI could afflict you farther.\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nDo, Paulina;\\r\\nFor this affliction has a taste as sweet\\r\\nAs any cordial comfort. Still, methinks,\\r\\nThere is an air comes from her: what fine chisel\\r\\nCould ever yet cut breath? Let no man mock me,\\r\\nFor I will kiss her.\\r\\nPAULINA\\r\\nGood my lord, forbear:\\r\\nThe ruddiness upon her lip is wet;\\r\\nYou'll mar it if you kiss it, stain your own\\r\\nWith oily painting. Shall I draw the curtain?\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nNo, not these twenty years.\\r\\nPERDITA\\r\\nSo long could I\\r\\nStand by, a looker on.\\r\\nPAULINA\\r\\nEither forbear,\\r\\nQuit presently the chapel, or resolve you\\r\\nFor more amazement. If you can behold it,\\r\\nI'll make the statue move indeed, descend\\r\\nAnd take you by the hand; but then you'll think--\\r\\nWhich I protest against--I am assisted\\r\\nBy wicked powers.\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nWhat you can make her do,\\r\\nI am content to look on: what to speak,\\r\\nI am content to hear; for 'tis as easy\\r\\nTo make her speak as move.\\r\\nPAULINA\\r\\nIt is required\\r\\nYou do awake your faith. Then all stand still;\\r\\nOn: those that think it is unlawful business\\r\\nI am about, let them depart.\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nProceed:\\r\\nNo foot shall stir.\\r\\nPAULINA\\r\\nMusic, awake her; strike!\\r\\nMusic\\r\\n\\r\\n'Tis time; descend; be stone no more; approach;\\r\\nStrike all that look upon with marvel. Come,\\r\\nI'll fill your grave up: stir, nay, come away,\\r\\nBequeath to death your numbness, for from him\\r\\nDear life redeems you. You perceive she stirs:\\r\\nHERMIONE comes down\\r\\n\\r\\nStart not; her actions shall be holy as\\r\\nYou hear my spell is lawful: do not shun her\\r\\nUntil you see her die again; for then\\r\\nYou kill her double. Nay, present your hand:\\r\\nWhen she was young you woo'd her; now in age\\r\\nIs she become the suitor?\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nO, she's warm!\\r\\nIf this be magic, let it be an art\\r\\nLawful as eating.\\r\\nPOLIXENES\\r\\nShe embraces him.\\r\\nCAMILLO\\r\\nShe hangs about his neck:\\r\\nIf she pertain to life let her speak too.\\r\\nPOLIXENES\\r\\nAy, and make't manifest where she has lived,\\r\\nOr how stolen from the dead.\\r\\nPAULINA\\r\\nThat she is living,\\r\\nWere it but told you, should be hooted at\\r\\nLike an old tale: but it appears she lives,\\r\\nThough yet she speak not. Mark a little while.\\r\\nPlease you to interpose, fair madam: kneel\\r\\nAnd pray your mother's blessing. Turn, good lady;\\r\\nOur Perdita is found.\\r\\nHERMIONE\\r\\nYou gods, look down\\r\\nAnd from your sacred vials pour your graces\\r\\nUpon my daughter's head! Tell me, mine own.\\r\\nWhere hast thou been preserved? where lived? how found\\r\\nThy father's court? for thou shalt hear that I,\\r\\nKnowing by Paulina that the oracle\\r\\nGave hope thou wast in being, have preserved\\r\\nMyself to see the issue.\\r\\nPAULINA\\r\\nThere's time enough for that;\\r\\nLest they desire upon this push to trouble\\r\\nYour joys with like relation. Go together,\\r\\nYou precious winners all; your exultation\\r\\nPartake to every one. I, an old turtle,\\r\\nWill wing me to some wither'd bough and there\\r\\nMy mate, that's never to be found again,\\r\\nLament till I am lost.\\r\\nLEONTES\\r\\nO, peace, Paulina!\\r\\nThou shouldst a husband take by my consent,\\r\\nAs I by thine a wife: this is a match,\\r\\nAnd made between's by vows. Thou hast found mine;\\r\\nBut how, is to be question'd; for I saw her,\\r\\nAs I thought, dead, and have in vain said many\\r\\nA prayer upon her grave. I'll not seek far--\\r\\nFor him, I partly know his mind--to find thee\\r\\nAn honourable husband. Come, Camillo,\\r\\nAnd take her by the hand, whose worth and honesty\\r\\nIs richly noted and here justified\\r\\nBy us, a pair of kings. Let's from this place.\\r\\nWhat! look upon my brother: both your pardons,\\r\\nThat e'er I put between your holy looks\\r\\nMy ill suspicion. This is your son-in-law,\\r\\nAnd son unto the king, who, heavens directing,\\r\\nIs troth-plight to your daughter. Good Paulina,\\r\\nLead us from hence, where we may leisurely\\r\\nEach one demand an answer to his part\\r\\nPerform'd in this wide gap of time since first\\r\\nWe were dissever'd: hastily lead away.\\r\\nExeunt\")"
