\begin{abstract}
Natural Language Processing has evolved in a multitude of way, and sees use in many facets of modern life. It also exists as a stark pillar of modernity within computer science. In contrast to this, the writings of William Shakespeare are iconic relics from a prior millennia. We asked the question: "Can current modern methods reproduce plausible results when attempting to extend Shakespeare's corpora?" In pursuit of this question, a model was built and used to provide a host of 'Shakespearean' text, which was evaluating by human elements, alongside other similar models, to evaluate the results in a non-biased manner. The process begins with the creation of a corpus of Shakespeare's plays, which are then used to generate new lines of dialogue in an attempt to reproduce the original wording as closely as possible. This technique has been applied successfully to both prose and poetry.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
%project goals should be well described here
We have spent our time with the development of a natural language generator, with the explicit purpose of generating legible text in a Shakespearean format. To accomplish this, we built a model, with guidance from multiple online sources to generate text based off a brief prompt. The AI model then outputs what it believe to be appropriate characters and words, to form Shakespearean text. When building the generation model, we attempted both a LTSM and GRU approach. In the end we opted to go with the GRU approach, as it had an expedient run-time and produced seemingly superior results. In order to test the validity of our model, we implemented a brief questionnaire using google forms, which was supplied to peers, friends, and family. In this questionnaire, we posed various texts, either from Shakespeare himself, or generated by our or another model. The respondents were not given information on the source of the texts. The respondents were then asked to rate the given text on a scale of one to ten, with one being the least like Shakespeare and ten being the most like Shakespeare. \\
In the pages to follow, we evaluate and explicate our data, and will determine the success of both our model in comparison to the others, as well as to the source material. Following this, we evaluate the general success text generation on producing Shakespearean English. As an added exercise, we examined text generated based off other creative commons literature using our model, although this was not evaluated on a large scale.

\end{figure}

As can be observed under \ref{fig:AverageScores} our model performs slightly under the other two models. Given that the John Fish model operates on GRU and the Towards Data Science Model is using an LSTM, we can surmise that our under-performance is not necessarily due to model selection. That does not mean model choice was not a factor, as the lower average of the John Fish could hint to a slightly inferior performance from a GRU system. Our testing reflected this, however we chose a GRU system, as the impact to performance an LSTM had was not worth the slight increase to results we observed. 
That said, all models performed similarly well, and not drastically behind the performance of Shakespeare's writings (functionally our control).
